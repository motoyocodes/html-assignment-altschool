I killed Sirius Black!

00:30.235 --> 00:31.795
He's back.

02:55.785 --> 02:58.495
The police are
continuing with the investigation...

02:58.705 --> 03:00.790
... into the cause
of the Millennium Bridge disaster.

03:00.895 --> 03:04.645
Traffic has been halted
as police search for survivors.

03:04.750 --> 03:06.420
The surrounding area remains closed.

03:06.630 --> 03:09.755
The mayor has urged Londoners
to remain calm...

03:15.180 --> 03:16.430
"Harry Potter."

03:16.845 --> 03:18.515
Who's Harry Potter?

03:20.080 --> 03:22.060
Oh, no one.

03:22.685 --> 03:24.040
Bit of a tosser, really.

03:26.540 --> 03:28.210
Funny, that paper of yours.

03:28.315 --> 03:31.025
Couple nights ago,
I could've sworn I saw a picture move.

03:31.130 --> 03:33.945
- Really?
- Thought I was going around the twist.

03:40.618 --> 03:45.206
- Hey, I was wondering...
- Eleven. That's when I get off.

03:45.414 --> 03:48.229
You can tell me all about
that tosser Harry Potter.

04:39.110 --> 04:41.299
You've been reckless this summer, Harry.

04:41.508 --> 04:43.802
I like riding around on trains.

04:44.844 --> 04:46.930
Takes my mind off things.

04:48.494 --> 04:50.370
Rather unpleasant to behold, isn't it?

04:50.579 --> 04:53.915
The tale is thrilling,
if I say so myself.

04:54.020 --> 04:56.626
But now is not the time to tell it.

04:56.730 --> 04:58.399
Take my arm.

05:01.527 --> 05:03.299
Do as I say.

05:12.370 --> 05:13.830
I just Apparated, didn't I?

05:14.038 --> 05:17.166
Indeed. Quite successfully too,
I might add.

05:17.375 --> 05:19.981
Most people vomit the first time.

05:20.190 --> 05:21.962
I can't imagine why.

05:29.574 --> 05:33.431
Welcome to the
charming village of Budleigh Babberton.

05:33.536 --> 05:37.810
Harry, I assume, right about now, you're
wondering why I brought you here.

05:38.019 --> 05:39.687
Am I right?

05:39.896 --> 05:43.232
Actually, sir, after all these years,
I just sort of go with it.

05:47.820 --> 05:49.696
Wands out, Harry.

06:01.061 --> 06:02.521
Horace?

06:14.720 --> 06:16.075
Horace?

07:08.103 --> 07:09.667
Merlin's beard!

07:10.814 --> 07:13.107
No need to disfigure me, Albus.

07:13.316 --> 07:16.965
Well, I must say you
make a very convincing armchair, Horace.

07:18.008 --> 07:22.283
It's all in the upholstery. I come by the
stuffing naturally. What gave me away?

07:23.325 --> 07:25.202
Dragon's blood.

07:25.619 --> 07:28.747
- Oh.
- Oh, yes, introductions.

07:28.851 --> 07:32.917
Harry, I'd like you to meet
an old friend and colleague of mine...

07:33.022 --> 07:34.481
...Horace Slughorn.

07:34.690 --> 07:36.150
Horace...

07:36.358 --> 07:39.173
...well, you know who this is.

07:39.695 --> 07:41.988
Harry Potter.

07:44.803 --> 07:46.576
What's with all the theatrics, Horace?

07:46.784 --> 07:49.183
You weren't, by any chance,
waiting for someone else?

07:49.391 --> 07:51.893
Someone else?
I'm sure I don't know what you mean.

07:52.310 --> 07:55.751
All right, the Death Eaters have been
trying to recruit me for over a year.

07:55.960 --> 07:57.315
Do you know what that's like?

07:57.419 --> 08:01.173
You can only say no so many times, so
I never stay anywhere more than a week.

08:01.590 --> 08:03.675
Muggles who own this
are in the Canary Islands.

08:03.884 --> 08:08.784
Well, I think we should put it back
in order for them, don't you? Mind.

08:43.504 --> 08:45.276
That was fun.

08:46.215 --> 08:49.238
- Do you mind if I use the loo?
- No, of course.

08:50.594 --> 08:53.200
Don't think I don't know
why you're here, Albus.

08:53.409 --> 08:58.935
The answer's still no.
Absolutely and unequivocally, no.

09:07.276 --> 09:09.361
You're very like your father.

09:10.508 --> 09:13.428
- Except for the eyes. You have your...
- My mother's eyes. Yeah.

09:13.532 --> 09:17.285
Lily. Lovely Lily. She was
exceedingly bright, your mother.

09:17.390 --> 09:20.726
Even more impressive when one
considers she was Muggle-born.

09:20.935 --> 09:23.541
One of my best friends is Muggle-born.
Best in our year.

09:23.645 --> 09:25.731
Please don't think I'm prejudiced.
No, no.

09:25.939 --> 09:30.110
Your mother was one of my
absolute favorites. Look, there she is.

09:30.318 --> 09:32.091
Right at the front.

09:40.536 --> 09:43.560
All mine. Each and every one.

09:43.664 --> 09:45.749
Ex-students, I mean.

09:47.939 --> 09:52.422
You recognize Barnabas Cuffe,
editor of The Daily Prophet.

09:53.256 --> 09:55.759
Always takes my owl,
should I wish to register an opinion...

09:55.967 --> 09:57.218
...on the news of the day.

09:58.157 --> 10:01.076
Gwenog Jones,
captain of the Holyhead Harpies.

10:01.285 --> 10:03.683
Free tickets whenever I want them.

10:03.995 --> 10:06.915
Of course, I haven't been
to a match in some time.

10:08.583 --> 10:10.147
Ah, yes.

10:10.356 --> 10:12.441
Regulus Black.

10:12.649 --> 10:16.611
You no doubt know of his older brother
Sirius. Died a few weeks ago.

10:16.820 --> 10:19.322
I taught the whole Black family,
except Sirius.

10:19.531 --> 10:21.720
It's a shame. Talented boy.

10:21.825 --> 10:27.142
I got Regulus when he came along,
of course, but I'd have liked the set.

10:28.080 --> 10:29.227
Horace?

10:29.957 --> 10:31.521
Do you mind if I take this?

10:36.004 --> 10:39.758
- I do love knitting patterns.
- Yes, of course. But you're not leaving?

10:39.862 --> 10:42.990
I think I know a lost cause
when I see one. Regrettable.

10:43.199 --> 10:45.492
I would have considered it
a personal triumph...

10:45.597 --> 10:48.620
...had you consented to return
to Hogwarts. Oh, well.

10:48.725 --> 10:51.748
You're like my friend Mr. Potter here,
one of a kind.

10:52.374 --> 10:54.146
Well, bye-bye, Horace.

10:55.189 --> 10:56.440
Bye.

11:07.179 --> 11:09.994
All right. I'll do it.

11:10.099 --> 11:14.686
But I want Professor Merrythought's old
office, not the water closet I had before.

11:14.895 --> 11:19.065
And I expect a raise.
These are mad times we live in. Mad!

11:20.838 --> 11:22.506
They are indeed.

11:25.947 --> 11:27.823
Sir, exactly what was all that about?

11:28.345 --> 11:33.037
You are talented, famous and powerful.
Everything Horace values.

11:33.245 --> 11:36.686
Professor Slughorn is gonna try
to collect you, Harry.

11:36.790 --> 11:39.188
You would be his crowning jewel.

11:39.397 --> 11:44.923
That's why he's returning to Hogwarts.
And it's crucial he should return.

11:45.652 --> 11:48.780
I fear I may have stolen
a wondrous night from you, Harry.

11:48.885 --> 11:53.994
She was, truthfully, very pretty, the girl.

11:54.098 --> 11:57.539
It's all right, sir. I'll go back tomorrow,
make some excuse.

11:57.747 --> 12:01.396
Oh, you'll not be returning
to Little Whinging tonight, Harry.

12:01.605 --> 12:04.628
But, sir, what about Hedwig?
And my trunk?

12:04.733 --> 12:07.444
Both are waiting for you.

12:40.912 --> 12:42.476
Hedwig.

12:45.083 --> 12:46.334
Mum?

12:47.689 --> 12:49.045
Ginny, what is it?

12:49.462 --> 12:51.756
I was only wondering
when Harry got here.

12:51.860 --> 12:55.092
- What? Harry? Harry who?
- Harry Potter, of course.

12:55.301 --> 12:58.429
I think I'd know if Harry Potter
was in my house, wouldn't I?

12:58.637 --> 13:02.182
- His trunk's in the kitchen, and his owl.
- No, dear, I seriously doubt that.

13:04.789 --> 13:06.457
Harry? Did someone say "Harry"?

13:06.561 --> 13:08.542
Me, nosy. Is he up there with you?

13:08.751 --> 13:11.774
Of course not. I'd know if my best friend
was in my room, wouldn't I?

13:11.983 --> 13:14.381
- Is that an owl?
- You haven't seen him, have you?

13:14.589 --> 13:16.362
He's wandering about the house.

13:16.570 --> 13:18.239
- Really?
- Really.

13:18.551 --> 13:20.115
Harry!

13:26.371 --> 13:28.039
Harry!

13:28.561 --> 13:29.812
Hello.

13:29.916 --> 13:33.253
What a lovely surprise.

13:35.338 --> 13:37.632
Why didn't you let us know
you were coming?

13:37.840 --> 13:40.655
- I didn't know. Dumbledore.
- Oh, that man.

13:40.864 --> 13:43.053
But then, what would we do
without him?

13:44.305 --> 13:47.015
Got a bit of toothpaste.

13:54.210 --> 13:55.669
So when did you get here?

13:55.774 --> 13:57.546
A few days ago.

13:58.484 --> 14:00.778
Though for a while,
I wasn't sure I was coming.

14:02.551 --> 14:04.844
Mum sort of lost it last week.

14:05.157 --> 14:07.972
Said Ginny and I had no business
going back to Hogwarts.

14:08.181 --> 14:09.536
That it's too dangerous.

14:09.745 --> 14:12.560
- Oh, come on.
- She's not alone.

14:12.664 --> 14:16.001
Even my parents, and they're Muggles,
know something bad's happening.

14:16.209 --> 14:20.067
Anyway, Dad stepped in,
told her she was being barmy...

14:20.380 --> 14:22.778
...and it took a few days,
but she came around.

14:24.133 --> 14:28.095
But this is Hogwarts we're talking about.
It's Dumbledore. What could be safer?

14:28.721 --> 14:31.953
There's been a lot of talk recently that...

14:32.683 --> 14:34.351
...Dumbledore's got a bit old.

14:34.560 --> 14:36.332
Rubbish! Well, he's only...

14:36.541 --> 14:38.105
What is he?

14:38.313 --> 14:41.441
Hundred and fifty?
Give or take a few years.

15:01.564 --> 15:05.422
Cissy! You can't do this!
He can't be trusted!

15:05.526 --> 15:06.986
The Dark Lord trusts him.

15:07.194 --> 15:10.739
- The Dark Lord's mistaken.
- Pfft.

15:40.037 --> 15:42.331
Run along, Wormtail.

15:45.146 --> 15:47.753
I know I ought not to be here.

15:48.900 --> 15:51.715
The Dark Lord himself
forbade me to speak of this.

15:51.819 --> 15:54.530
If the Dark Lord has forbidden it,
you ought not to speak.

15:54.634 --> 15:58.909
Put it down, Bella.
We mustn't touch what isn't ours.

16:03.079 --> 16:06.729
As it so happens,
I'm aware of your situation, Narcissa.

16:06.937 --> 16:08.084
You?

16:09.231 --> 16:11.525
The Dark Lord told you?

16:12.046 --> 16:14.653
Your sister doubts me.

16:15.695 --> 16:18.510
Understandable. Over the years
I've played my part well.

16:18.615 --> 16:22.368
So well, I've deceived
one of the greatest wizards of all time.

16:23.828 --> 16:27.790
Dumbledore is a great wizard.
Only a fool would question it.

16:27.894 --> 16:29.875
I don't doubt you, Severus.

16:29.979 --> 16:33.212
You should be honored, Cissy.
As should Draco.

16:37.591 --> 16:39.467
He's just a boy.

16:40.302 --> 16:43.325
I can't change the Dark Lord's mind.

16:44.993 --> 16:48.643
But it might be possible
for me to help Draco.

16:50.415 --> 16:53.335
- Severus.
- Swear to it.

16:57.401 --> 16:59.799
Make the Unbreakable Vow.

17:03.657 --> 17:06.785
It's just empty words.

17:06.889 --> 17:10.121
He'll give it his best effort.

17:10.329 --> 17:12.623
But when it matters most...

17:14.500 --> 17:18.462
...he'll just slither back into his hole.

17:22.007 --> 17:23.571
Coward.

17:26.595 --> 17:30.244
Take out your wand.

17:43.381 --> 17:44.528
Will you...

17:44.736 --> 17:46.822
...Severus Snape...

17:46.926 --> 17:49.845
...watch over Draco Malfoy...

17:50.054 --> 17:54.850
...as he attempts to fulfill
the Dark Lord's wishes?

17:55.997 --> 17:57.874
I will.

17:59.333 --> 18:02.983
And will you,
to the best of your ability...

18:03.608 --> 18:05.798
...protect him from harm?

18:07.257 --> 18:08.613
I will.

18:10.698 --> 18:13.200
And if Draco should fail...

18:14.347 --> 18:18.935
...will you yourself carry out the deed...

18:19.143 --> 18:24.148
...the Dark Lord
has ordered Draco to perform?

18:29.361 --> 18:30.821
I will.

18:53.655 --> 18:56.678
Step up! Step up!
We've got Fainting Fancies!

18:56.783 --> 18:57.825
Nosebleed Nougats!

18:58.034 --> 19:01.057
- And just in time for school...
- Puking Pastilles!

19:02.413 --> 19:05.124
- Into the cauldron, handsome.
- Into the cauldron, handsome.

19:05.332 --> 19:08.356
I will have order!

19:08.564 --> 19:12.944
I really hate children. I will have order!

19:13.152 --> 19:17.948
I really hate children. I will have order!

19:19.095 --> 19:22.014
- Peruvian Instant Darkness Powder.
- A real money spinner, that.

19:22.119 --> 19:24.308
Handy if you need
to make a quick getaway.

19:24.413 --> 19:26.185
- Hello, ladies.
- Hello, ladies.

19:26.394 --> 19:29.626
- Love potions, eh?
- Yeah, they really do work.

19:29.834 --> 19:33.171
Then again, the way we hear it, sis,
you're doing just fine on your own.

19:33.379 --> 19:34.526
Meaning?

19:34.630 --> 19:36.820
Are you not
currently dating Dean Thomas?

19:37.237 --> 19:39.009
It's none of your business.

19:44.744 --> 19:45.787
How much for this?

19:45.995 --> 19:47.351
- Five Galleons.
- Five Galleons.

19:47.559 --> 19:49.644
- How much for me?
- Five Galleons.

19:49.853 --> 19:51.000
I'm your brother.

19:51.417 --> 19:53.398
- Ten Galleons.
- Ten Galleons.

19:55.379 --> 19:57.047
Come on, let's go.

19:59.445 --> 20:00.905
Hi, Ron.

20:01.635 --> 20:02.990
Hi.

20:16.127 --> 20:20.194
How are Fred and George
doing it? Half the Alley's closed down.

20:20.402 --> 20:22.904
Fred reckons
people need a laugh these days.

20:23.426 --> 20:25.407
I reckon he's right.

20:27.179 --> 20:28.743
Oh, no.

20:29.369 --> 20:31.558
Everyone got their wands
from Ollivander's.

20:44.070 --> 20:45.425
Harry?

20:47.198 --> 20:49.283
Is it me, or do Draco and Mummy
look like two people...

20:49.492 --> 20:51.160
...who don't want to be followed?

22:36.466 --> 22:37.717
Quibbler.

22:39.594 --> 22:41.054
Quibbler.

22:43.035 --> 22:47.727
He's lovely. They've been known
to sing on Boxing Day, you know.

22:47.831 --> 22:50.229
- Quibbler?
- Oh, please.

22:51.480 --> 22:53.982
- What's a Wrackspurt?
- They're invisible creatures.

22:54.191 --> 22:57.319
They float in your ears
and make your brain go fuzzy.

22:57.840 --> 22:59.404
Quibbler.

23:09.831 --> 23:12.646
So, what was Draco doing
with that weird-looking cabinet?

23:12.750 --> 23:14.522
And who were all those people?

23:14.627 --> 23:17.755
Don't you see?
It was a ceremony, an initiation.

23:17.963 --> 23:19.840
Stop it, Harry.
I know where you're going.

23:20.048 --> 23:22.551
It's happened. He's one of them.

23:22.759 --> 23:24.219
One of what?

23:24.949 --> 23:28.389
Harry is under the impression
Draco Malfoy is now a Death Eater.

23:28.598 --> 23:30.579
You're barking.

23:30.683 --> 23:32.873
What would You-Know-Who
want with Malfoy?

23:32.977 --> 23:37.043
Well, then what's he doing in Borgin
and Burkes? Browsing for furniture?

23:37.252 --> 23:39.129
It's a creepy shop. He's a creepy bloke.

23:39.233 --> 23:43.091
Look, his father is a Death Eater.
It only makes sense.

23:43.299 --> 23:44.863
Hermione saw it with her own eyes.

23:45.072 --> 23:48.408
I told you, I don't know what I saw.

23:50.076 --> 23:51.640
I need some air.

24:08.427 --> 24:12.180
Don't worry. When we get
to Hogwarts, we'll sort it out.

24:32.616 --> 24:35.848
- What was that? Blaise?
- Don't know.

24:35.952 --> 24:39.080
Relax, boys. It's probably just
a first-year messing around.

24:39.289 --> 24:42.625
Come on, Draco. Sit down.
We'll be at Hogwarts soon.

24:52.322 --> 24:56.075
Hogwarts.
What a pathetic excuse for a school.

24:56.284 --> 24:58.265
I'd pitch myself off
the Astronomy Tower...

24:58.473 --> 25:00.559
...if I had to continue
for another two years.

25:00.767 --> 25:02.123
What's that supposed to mean?

25:03.374 --> 25:07.231
Let's just say you won't see me wasting
my time in Charms class next year.

25:09.004 --> 25:10.776
Amused, Blaise?

25:12.236 --> 25:14.634
We'll see just who's laughing in the end.

25:36.842 --> 25:40.596
You two go on.
I wanna check something.

25:42.785 --> 25:44.036
Where's Harry?

25:44.245 --> 25:47.164
He's probably already on the platform.
Come on.

26:02.908 --> 26:06.349
Didn't Mummy ever tell you
it was rude to eavesdrop, Potter?

26:06.557 --> 26:08.121
Petrificus Totalus.

26:19.382 --> 26:20.842
Oh, yeah...

26:21.259 --> 26:24.491
...she was dead before you could wipe
the drool off your chin.

26:30.017 --> 26:33.145
That's for my father.
Enjoy your ride back to London.

27:17.040 --> 27:18.812
Finite.

27:24.859 --> 27:26.215
- Hello, Harry.
- Luna!

27:26.528 --> 27:31.324
- How'd you know where I was?
- Wrackspurts. Your head's full of them.

27:37.997 --> 27:40.708
Sorry I made you miss
the carriages, by the way, Luna.

27:40.812 --> 27:44.044
That's all right.
It was like being with a friend.

27:44.148 --> 27:46.233
Oh, I am your friend, Luna.

27:46.651 --> 27:48.423
That's nice.

27:48.632 --> 27:51.759
About time. I've been looking
all over for you two.

27:51.968 --> 27:54.783
Right. Names?

27:55.096 --> 27:57.390
Professor Flitwick,
you've known me for five years.

27:57.598 --> 27:59.683
No exceptions, Potter.

28:00.309 --> 28:01.977
Who are those people?

28:02.186 --> 28:04.480
Aurors. For security.

28:04.688 --> 28:06.148
What's this cane here, then?

28:06.356 --> 28:08.650
It's not a cane, you cretin.
It's a walking stick.

28:08.859 --> 28:12.821
And what exactly would you
be wanting with a...?

28:13.968 --> 28:17.096
Could be construed
as an offensive weapon.

28:17.200 --> 28:22.517
It's all right, Mr. Filch.
I can vouch for Mr. Malfoy.

28:29.920 --> 28:31.797
Nice face, Potter.

28:38.365 --> 28:40.763
Would you like me to fix it for you?

28:40.868 --> 28:44.621
Personally, I think you look
a bit more devil-may-care this way...

28:44.830 --> 28:46.394
...but it's up to you.

28:46.811 --> 28:49.104
Well, have you ever fixed a nose before?

28:49.313 --> 28:52.962
No, but I've done several toes,
and how different are they, really?

28:54.005 --> 28:57.967
Um... Okay, yeah. Give it a go.

29:00.365 --> 29:02.450
- Episkey.
- Ah!

29:08.498 --> 29:11.730
- How do I look?
- Exceptionally ordinary.

29:12.877 --> 29:14.232
Brilliant.

29:21.635 --> 29:23.616
Don't worry. He'll be here in a minute.

29:27.473 --> 29:30.184
Will you stop eating?

29:30.393 --> 29:32.687
Your best friend is missing!

29:32.791 --> 29:36.023
Oi. Turn around, you lunatic.

29:38.838 --> 29:40.402
He's covered in blood again.

29:41.028 --> 29:44.781
- Why is it he's always covered in blood?
- Looks like it's his own this time.

29:45.198 --> 29:47.075
Where have you been?

29:47.284 --> 29:49.786
- What happened to your face?
- Later.

29:49.890 --> 29:51.558
What've I missed?

29:52.080 --> 29:55.833
Sorting Hat urged us all to be brave
and strong in these troubled times.

29:56.042 --> 29:59.587
Easy for it to say, huh?
It's a hat, isn't it?

30:07.406 --> 30:09.179
Very best of evenings to you all.

30:09.283 --> 30:10.326
Thanks.

30:12.515 --> 30:17.207
First off, let me introduce
the newest member of our staff...

30:17.416 --> 30:19.605
...Horace Slughorn.

30:23.567 --> 30:25.444
Professor Slughorn, I'm happy to say...

30:25.548 --> 30:29.823
...has agreed to resume
his old post as Potions Master.

30:30.032 --> 30:32.951
Meanwhile, the post of
Defense Against the Dark Arts...

30:33.160 --> 30:34.932
...will be taken by Professor Snape.

30:35.349 --> 30:36.809
Snape?

30:42.856 --> 30:44.420
Now, as you know...

30:44.629 --> 30:48.278
...each and every one of you was searched
upon your arrival here tonight.

30:48.486 --> 30:50.467
And you have the right to know why.

30:51.301 --> 30:54.846
Once there was a young man,
who, like you...

30:55.055 --> 30:57.453
...sat in this very hall...

30:57.870 --> 31:02.458
...walked this castle's corridors,
slept under its roof.

31:03.083 --> 31:07.462
He seemed to all the world
a student like any other.

31:07.567 --> 31:09.131
His name?

31:10.590 --> 31:11.946
Tom Riddle.

31:17.159 --> 31:18.827
Today, of course...

31:19.348 --> 31:22.685
...he's known all over the world
by another name.

31:23.832 --> 31:29.045
Which is why, as I stand looking out
upon you all tonight...

31:29.253 --> 31:31.547
...I'm reminded of a sobering fact.

31:32.798 --> 31:35.926
Every day, every hour...

31:36.031 --> 31:38.012
...this very minute, perhaps...

31:38.220 --> 31:42.495
...dark forces attempt to penetrate
this castle's walls.

31:44.163 --> 31:49.689
But in the end,
their greatest weapon is you.

31:52.713 --> 31:54.902
Just something to think about.

31:56.153 --> 31:57.717
Now, off to bed. Pip-pip.

31:59.386 --> 32:01.158
That was cheerful.

32:06.476 --> 32:11.167
History of Magic is upstairs,
ladies, not down.

32:12.002 --> 32:17.006
Mr. Davies! Mr. Davies!
That is the girls' lavatory.

32:19.821 --> 32:21.177
Potter.

32:22.532 --> 32:24.513
Oh, this can't be good.

32:27.850 --> 32:29.205
Enjoying ourselves, are we?

32:30.143 --> 32:33.271
- I had a free period this morning.
- So I noticed.

32:33.793 --> 32:36.191
I would think you would want to
fill it with Potions.

32:36.399 --> 32:39.110
Or is it no longer your ambition
to become an Auror?

32:39.840 --> 32:43.489
It was, but I was told I had to
get an "Outstanding" in my O.W.L.

32:43.698 --> 32:46.513
So you did, when Professor Snape
was teaching Potions.

32:46.721 --> 32:51.309
However, Professor Slughorn is perfectly
happy to accept N.E.W.T. s students...

32:51.413 --> 32:53.290
...with "Exceeds Expectations."

32:53.707 --> 32:55.375
Brilliant. Um...

32:55.584 --> 32:58.086
- Well, I'll head there straightaway.
- Oh, good, good.

32:58.190 --> 33:03.091
Potter, take Weasley with you.
He looks far too happy over there.

33:04.967 --> 33:06.219
I don't wanna take Potions.

33:06.427 --> 33:09.138
This is Quidditch trials coming up.
I need to practice.

33:10.389 --> 33:12.266
Attention to detail
in the preparation...

33:12.474 --> 33:14.768
...is the prerequisite of all planning.

33:16.228 --> 33:17.688
Ah.

33:17.792 --> 33:21.754
Harry, my boy, I was beginning to worry.
We've brought someone with us, I see.

33:22.379 --> 33:23.526
Ron Weasley, sir.

33:24.152 --> 33:26.550
But I'm dead awful at Potions,
a menace, actually.

33:26.759 --> 33:28.844
- I'm gonna...
- Nonsense, we'll sort you out.

33:28.948 --> 33:32.076
Any friend of Harry's is a friend of mine.
Get your books out.

33:32.285 --> 33:34.787
I haven't actually got
my book yet, and nor has Ron.

33:34.995 --> 33:36.664
Get what you want from the cupboard.

33:36.872 --> 33:40.209
Now, as I was saying,
I prepared some concoctions this morning.

33:40.313 --> 33:44.275
Any ideas what these might be?

33:45.839 --> 33:48.341
- Yes, Miss...?
- Granger, sir.

33:51.678 --> 33:56.057
That one there is Veritaserum.
It's a truth-telling serum.

33:56.265 --> 33:58.976
And that would be Polyjuice Potion.

34:02.625 --> 34:04.293
It's terribly tricky to make.

34:04.398 --> 34:06.483
And this is Amortentia...

34:06.692 --> 34:09.090
...the most powerful
love potion in the world.

34:10.028 --> 34:13.781
It's rumored to smell differently to each
person according to what attracts them.

34:15.137 --> 34:17.118
For example, I smell...

34:17.848 --> 34:21.914
...freshly mown grass,
and new parchment, and...

34:22.123 --> 34:25.459
...spearmint toothpaste.

34:26.814 --> 34:30.255
Amortentia doesn't create
actual love. That would be impossible.

34:30.464 --> 34:35.468
But it does cause
a powerful infatuation or obsession.

34:35.677 --> 34:42.350
And for that reason, it is probably
the most dangerous potion in this room.

34:47.876 --> 34:50.691
Sir? You haven't told us
what's in that one.

34:51.004 --> 34:52.776
Oh, yes.

34:52.880 --> 34:55.487
What you see before you,
ladies and gentlemen...

34:55.695 --> 35:01.117
...is a curious little potion
known as Felix Felicis.

35:01.534 --> 35:03.724
But it is more commonly referred to as...

35:03.932 --> 35:09.250
- Liquid luck.
- Yes, Miss Granger. Liquid luck.

35:09.667 --> 35:12.690
Desperately tricky to make,
disastrous should you get it wrong.

35:13.525 --> 35:18.529
One sip and you will find
that all of your endeavors succeed.

35:20.510 --> 35:23.013
At least until the effects wear off.

35:23.847 --> 35:27.704
So this is what I offer each of you today.

35:27.913 --> 35:32.709
One tiny vial of liquid luck to the student
who, in the hour that remains...

35:32.918 --> 35:37.505
...manages to brew an acceptable
Draught of Living Death...

35:37.609 --> 35:40.946
...the recipes for which can be found
on page 10 of your books.

35:41.050 --> 35:44.699
I should point out, however, only once did
a student manage to brew a potion...

35:44.908 --> 35:48.244
...of sufficient quality to
claim this prize.

35:48.870 --> 35:51.059
Nevertheless, good luck to you all.

35:51.998 --> 35:53.770
Let the brewing commence.

36:29.533 --> 36:31.409
How did you do that?

36:31.931 --> 36:34.120
You crush it. Don't cut it.

36:34.329 --> 36:36.727
No. The instructions
specifically say to cut.

36:36.935 --> 36:38.812
No, really.

37:16.243 --> 37:19.475
Merlin's beard! It is perfect.

37:20.935 --> 37:24.167
So perfect I daresay
one drop would kill us all.

37:27.503 --> 37:29.380
So here we are, then, as promised.

37:29.589 --> 37:32.821
One vial of Felix Felicis.

37:32.925 --> 37:35.010
Congratulations.

37:35.532 --> 37:38.242
Use it well.

38:05.872 --> 38:08.583
Harry, you got my message. Come in.

38:10.251 --> 38:11.607
How are you?

38:11.711 --> 38:13.275
I'm fine, sir.

38:13.484 --> 38:14.735
Enjoying your classes?

38:15.986 --> 38:19.010
I know Professor Slughorn
is most impressed with you.

38:19.739 --> 38:22.033
I think he overestimates my abilities, sir.

38:22.763 --> 38:23.806
Do you?

38:24.431 --> 38:25.682
Definitely.

38:27.663 --> 38:30.479
What about your activities
outside the classroom?

38:31.730 --> 38:33.711
- Sir?
- Well, I notice you spend...

38:33.815 --> 38:36.526
...a great deal of time with Miss Granger.

38:36.630 --> 38:37.881
I can't help wondering...

38:38.090 --> 38:43.094
Oh, no, no. I mean, she's brilliant,
and we're friends, but, no.

38:43.199 --> 38:46.222
Forgive me. I was merely being curious.

38:47.369 --> 38:49.246
But enough chitchat.

38:49.455 --> 38:53.000
You must be wondering
why I summoned you here tonight.

38:53.625 --> 38:56.440
The answer lies here.

38:57.379 --> 38:59.568
What you are looking at are memories.

38:59.777 --> 39:03.634
In this case,
pertaining to one individual, Voldemort...

39:03.739 --> 39:06.241
...or, as he was known then, Tom Riddle.

39:09.265 --> 39:13.122
This vial contains
the most particular memory...

39:13.227 --> 39:15.520
...of the day I first met him.

39:16.772 --> 39:19.587
I'd like you to see it, if you would.

39:57.226 --> 40:01.501
I admit some confusion upon
receiving your letter, Mr. Dumbledore.

40:01.814 --> 40:05.254
In all the years Tom's been here,
he's never once had a family visitor.

40:05.463 --> 40:09.216
There have been incidents
with the other children. Nasty things.

40:11.614 --> 40:13.804
Tom, you have a visitor.

40:14.325 --> 40:15.993
How do you do, Tom?

40:23.500 --> 40:24.752
Don't.

40:32.571 --> 40:35.699
- You're the doctor, aren't you?
- No.

40:35.803 --> 40:37.889
I am a professor.

40:38.619 --> 40:40.391
I don't believe you.

40:40.600 --> 40:42.581
She wants me looked at.

40:43.206 --> 40:45.396
They think I'm different.

40:45.604 --> 40:47.064
Well, perhaps they're right.

40:47.272 --> 40:48.732
I'm not mad.

40:48.836 --> 40:52.173
Hogwarts is not a place for mad people.

40:52.381 --> 40:54.362
Hogwarts is a school.

40:55.092 --> 40:56.239
A school of magic.

41:00.827 --> 41:03.538
You can do things, can't you, Tom?

41:04.685 --> 41:07.291
Things other children can't.

41:08.751 --> 41:11.670
I can make things move
without touching them.

41:12.609 --> 41:16.154
I can make animals do what I want
without training them.

41:16.988 --> 41:20.533
I can make bad things happen
to people who are mean to me.

41:21.158 --> 41:23.139
I can make them hurt...

41:23.765 --> 41:25.224
...if I want.

41:25.850 --> 41:27.727
Who are you?

41:27.831 --> 41:30.021
Well, I'm like you, Tom.

41:31.272 --> 41:32.731
I'm different.

41:33.774 --> 41:35.130
Prove it.

41:42.741 --> 41:46.599
I think there's something in your wardrobe
trying to get out, Tom.

41:56.295 --> 42:00.049
Thievery is not tolerated at Hogwarts,
Tom.

42:00.257 --> 42:05.887
At Hogwarts, you'll be taught not only
how to use magic, but how to control it.

42:06.096 --> 42:07.243
You understand me?

42:11.205 --> 42:13.811
I can speak to snakes too.

42:15.062 --> 42:16.835
They find me.

42:17.773 --> 42:19.754
Whisper things.

42:19.963 --> 42:23.091
Is that normal for someone like me?

42:44.152 --> 42:47.488
Did you know, sir? Then?

42:47.593 --> 42:53.223
Did I know I'd just met the most
dangerous dark wizard of all time? No.

42:53.849 --> 42:55.934
If I had, I...

42:57.602 --> 43:00.104
Over time, while here at Hogwarts...

43:00.209 --> 43:03.545
...Tom Riddle grew close
to one particular teacher.

43:03.754 --> 43:05.526
Can you guess
who that teacher might be?

43:08.445 --> 43:11.990
You didn't bring Professor Slughorn back
simply to teach Potions, did you?

43:12.095 --> 43:14.180
No, I did not.

43:14.284 --> 43:18.142
You see, Professor Slughorn possesses
something I desire very dearly.

43:19.185 --> 43:21.061
And he will not give it up easily.

43:21.166 --> 43:24.398
You said Professor Slughorn
would try to collect me.

43:24.606 --> 43:25.857
I did.

43:26.587 --> 43:28.568
Do you want me to let him?

43:29.924 --> 43:31.279
Yes.

44:55.420 --> 44:57.192
All right. Um...

44:57.297 --> 45:00.425
This morning, I'm gonna be
putting you all through a few drills...

45:00.633 --> 45:02.718
...just to assess your strengths.

45:03.448 --> 45:05.429
Quiet! Please!

45:05.638 --> 45:06.785
Shut it!

45:10.642 --> 45:13.353
Thanks. All right. Um...

45:13.562 --> 45:15.647
Just because you
made the team last year...

45:15.856 --> 45:18.775
...does not guarantee you a spot this year.
Is that clear?

45:21.277 --> 45:22.529
Good.

45:31.287 --> 45:33.476
No hard feelings, Weasley, all right?

45:33.998 --> 45:35.249
Hard feelings?

45:35.457 --> 45:39.002
Yeah, I'll be going out for Keeper as well.
It's nothing personal.

45:39.106 --> 45:41.817
Really? Strapping guy like you?

45:41.922 --> 45:44.528
You've got more of a Beater's build,
don't you think?

45:44.737 --> 45:47.135
Keepers need to be quick, agile.

45:48.490 --> 45:50.263
Oh, I like my chances.

45:50.471 --> 45:54.225
Say, think you could introduce me
to your friend Granger?

45:54.433 --> 45:58.604
Wouldn't mind getting on
a first-name basis, know what I mean?

46:10.907 --> 46:12.575
Come on, Weasley!

46:12.784 --> 46:14.452
- Come on, Ron!
- Go on, Weasley!

46:16.016 --> 46:18.935
- Go on, Weasley!
- Yeah, Ron!

46:19.039 --> 46:20.291
Go on, Cormac!

46:36.869 --> 46:38.954
Come on, Ron!

46:47.191 --> 46:48.859
Come on, Ron.

46:49.589 --> 46:51.465
Come on, Ron.

47:09.399 --> 47:10.546
Confundus.

47:26.602 --> 47:29.000
Isn't he brilliant?

47:31.711 --> 47:35.256
I have to admit, I thought
I was gonna miss that last one.

47:35.569 --> 47:38.384
I hope Cormac's not taking it too hard.

47:38.801 --> 47:41.825
He's got a bit of a thing for you,
Hermione. Cormac.

47:42.867 --> 47:44.953
He's vile.

47:49.853 --> 47:52.147
Have you ever heard of this spell?
Sectumsempra?

47:52.251 --> 47:54.336
No, I haven't.

47:54.545 --> 47:57.673
And if you had a shred of self-respect,
you'd hand that book in.

47:57.881 --> 48:00.279
Not bloody likely. He's top of the class.

48:00.488 --> 48:04.658
He's even better than you, Hermione.
Slughorn thinks he's a genius.

48:05.805 --> 48:07.057
What?

48:07.891 --> 48:10.602
I'd like to know whose that book was.
Let's have a look.

48:10.810 --> 48:12.270
No.

48:13.729 --> 48:15.085
Why not?

48:15.606 --> 48:17.274
The binding is fragile.

48:17.379 --> 48:19.985
- The binding is fragile?
- Yeah.

48:24.260 --> 48:25.824
- Who's the Half-Blood Prince?
- Who?

48:26.033 --> 48:29.786
That's what it says right here: "This book
is property of the Half-Blood Prince."

48:47.094 --> 48:50.430
For weeks you carry around
this book, practically sleep with it...

48:50.639 --> 48:52.933
... yet you have no desire to find out
who he is?

48:53.141 --> 48:56.478
I didn't say I wasn't curious,
and I don't sleep with it.

48:56.686 --> 48:57.729
Well, it's true.

48:57.937 --> 49:01.691
I like a nice chat before I go to bed.
Now all you do is read that bloody book.

49:01.795 --> 49:03.776
It's just like being with Hermione.

49:05.131 --> 49:07.634
Well, I was curious, so I went to...

49:07.738 --> 49:10.345
- The library.
- The library. And?

49:11.283 --> 49:12.847
And nothing.

49:13.055 --> 49:16.079
I couldn't find a reference anywhere
to a Half-Blood Prince.

49:16.288 --> 49:18.373
- There we go. That settles it, then.
- Filius!

49:18.477 --> 49:20.875
I was hoping to find you
in the Three Broomsticks!

49:20.979 --> 49:25.671
No, emergency choir practice,
I'm afraid, Horace.

49:29.216 --> 49:31.614
Does anyone fancy a Butterbeer?

49:31.927 --> 49:34.221
A chum of mine
was sledging down Claxby Hill.

49:34.325 --> 49:37.974
We had a very long, homemade,
Norwegian-style sledge...

49:38.183 --> 49:40.581
No, not there. Over here.

49:41.207 --> 49:42.771
No, sit beside me.

49:44.543 --> 49:45.794
Okay.

49:47.254 --> 49:48.609
Something to drink?

49:48.818 --> 49:51.320
Three Butterbeers,
and some ginger in mine, please.

50:03.102 --> 50:05.083
Oh, bloody hell.

50:08.002 --> 50:09.879
Slick git.

50:10.192 --> 50:12.903
Honestly, Ronald,
they're only holding hands.

50:15.718 --> 50:16.969
And snogging.

50:17.595 --> 50:20.618
- I'd like to leave.
- What?

50:20.723 --> 50:22.391
You can't be serious.

50:22.495 --> 50:24.893
- That happens to be my sister.
- So?

50:25.102 --> 50:28.959
What if she looked over here and saw you
snogging me? You expect her to leave?

50:30.315 --> 50:32.713
- Hey, my boy!
- Hello, sir. Wonderful to see you.

50:32.921 --> 50:34.902
And you, and you.

50:35.111 --> 50:36.883
So, what brings you here?

50:36.988 --> 50:41.784
The Three Broomsticks and I go way back,
further than I care to admit.

50:41.888 --> 50:45.329
I can remember
when it was One Broomstick.

50:45.537 --> 50:48.874
All hands on deck, Granger.
Listen, my boy, in the old days...

50:49.082 --> 50:52.419
...I used to throw together
the occasional supper party...

50:52.627 --> 50:54.817
...for the select student or two.

50:55.025 --> 50:58.883
- Would you be game?
- I'd consider it an honor, sir.

51:00.343 --> 51:02.532
You would be welcome too, Granger.

51:03.262 --> 51:08.058
- I'd be delighted, sir.
- Splendid. Look for my owl.

51:08.892 --> 51:10.873
Good to see you, Wallenby.

51:15.774 --> 51:17.546
What are you playing at?

51:19.319 --> 51:21.613
Dumbledore's asked me
to get to know him.

51:21.821 --> 51:23.802
- Get to know him?
- I don't know.

51:23.906 --> 51:27.660
It must be important.
If it wasn't, Dumbledore wouldn't ask.

51:33.290 --> 51:35.375
Got a little bit...

51:46.323 --> 51:48.200
Katie, you don't know what it could be.

51:48.304 --> 51:49.764
- Harry.
- What?

51:49.972 --> 51:53.517
Did you hear what she said back
at the pub about me and her snogging?

51:54.247 --> 51:56.020
As if.

52:02.484 --> 52:05.820
I warned her.
I warned her not to touch it.

52:27.299 --> 52:30.009
Don't get any closer.
Get back, all of you.

52:42.521 --> 52:47.317
Do not touch that, except by
the wrappings. Do you understand?

53:00.872 --> 53:03.374
You're sure Katie did not have this
in her possession...

53:03.582 --> 53:06.085
...when she entered
the Three Broomsticks?

53:06.710 --> 53:08.274
It's like I said.

53:08.483 --> 53:13.383
She left to go to the loo, and when
she came back she had the package.

53:14.634 --> 53:17.345
She said it was important
that she deliver it.

53:18.179 --> 53:21.724
- Did she say to whom?
- To Professor Dumbledore.

53:22.037 --> 53:24.644
Very well. Thank you, Leanne.
You may go.

53:29.440 --> 53:34.861
Why is it when something happens
it is always you three?

53:36.008 --> 53:40.387
Believe me, professor, I've been asking
myself the same question for six years.

53:40.909 --> 53:42.577
McGONAGALL:
Oh, Severus.

53:48.207 --> 53:50.084
What do you think?

53:52.065 --> 53:56.861
I think Miss Bell is lucky to be alive.

53:56.965 --> 53:59.259
She was cursed, wasn't she?

53:59.468 --> 54:02.074
I know Katie. Off the pitch,
she wouldn't hurt a fly.

54:02.596 --> 54:06.141
If she was delivering that to Dumbledore,
she wasn't doing it knowingly.

54:06.349 --> 54:08.226
Yes, she was cursed.

54:09.060 --> 54:10.728
It was Malfoy.

54:12.605 --> 54:16.463
That is a very serious accusation, Potter.

54:16.567 --> 54:18.131
Indeed.

54:18.965 --> 54:22.406
- Your evidence?
- I just know.

54:23.136 --> 54:25.117
You just...

54:26.368 --> 54:27.723
...know.

54:30.747 --> 54:32.728
You astonish with your gifts, Potter.

54:32.832 --> 54:36.794
Gifts mere mortals
can only dream of possessing.

54:37.003 --> 54:43.154
How grand it must be
to be the Chosen One.

54:47.846 --> 54:51.287
I suggest you go back to your dormitories.
All of you.

55:01.817 --> 55:04.737
What do you suppose
Dean sees in her? Ginny?

55:06.405 --> 55:08.490
Well, what does she see in him?

55:08.594 --> 55:10.784
Dean? He's brilliant.

55:10.993 --> 55:13.808
You called him a slick git
not five hours ago.

55:14.016 --> 55:17.770
Yeah, well, he was running his hands
all over my sister, wasn't he?

55:17.978 --> 55:22.462
Something snaps, and you've gotta
hate him, you know? On principle.

55:23.191 --> 55:24.651
I suppose.

55:25.902 --> 55:29.134
- So, what is it he sees in her?
- I don't know.

55:29.864 --> 55:32.262
She's smart, funny.

55:32.992 --> 55:35.286
- Attractive.
- Attractive?

55:36.850 --> 55:40.395
- You know, she's got nice skin.
- Skin?

55:41.229 --> 55:43.001
Dean dates my sister
because of her skin?

55:43.210 --> 55:47.693
Well, no, I mean, I'm just saying
it could be a contributing factor.

55:51.030 --> 55:52.802
Hermione's got nice skin.

55:53.532 --> 55:56.243
Wouldn't you say? As skin goes, I mean.

55:57.286 --> 55:59.371
I've never really thought about it.

56:00.831 --> 56:02.603
But, I suppose, yeah.

56:03.333 --> 56:04.793
Very nice.

56:09.172 --> 56:12.612
- I think I'll be going to sleep now.
- Right. Yeah.

56:22.413 --> 56:26.375
So tell me, Cormac, do you see anything
of your Uncle Tiberius these days?

56:26.584 --> 56:29.086
Yes, sir. In fact,
I'm meant to go hunting with him...

56:29.190 --> 56:31.484
...and the Minister for Magic
over the holidays.

56:31.588 --> 56:34.612
Well, be sure to give them both my best.

56:34.716 --> 56:36.697
What about your uncle, Belby?

56:36.906 --> 56:40.347
For those who don't know, Marcus'
uncle invented the Wolfsbane Potion.

56:40.555 --> 56:43.370
- Is he working on anything new?
- Don't know.

56:43.474 --> 56:47.541
Him and Dad don't get on. Probably
because me dad says potions are rubbish.

56:47.749 --> 56:51.086
Says the only potion worth having
is a stiff one at the end of the day.

56:51.190 --> 56:56.299
What about you, Miss Granger? What does
your family do in the Muggle world?

56:57.133 --> 56:58.905
My parents are dentists.

57:03.493 --> 57:04.744
They tend to people's teeth.

57:04.953 --> 57:09.645
Fascinating. And is that considered
a dangerous profession?

57:09.853 --> 57:11.104
No.

57:13.085 --> 57:17.569
Although, one boy, Robbie Fenwick,
did bite my father once.

57:17.777 --> 57:19.028
He needed 10 stitches.

57:25.284 --> 57:28.933
Ah. Miss Weasley. Come in, come in.

57:31.644 --> 57:36.023
Look at her eyes.
They've been fighting again, her and Dean.

57:36.232 --> 57:38.943
Sorry. I'm not usually late.

57:42.696 --> 57:47.180
No matter. You're just in time for dessert,
that is, if Belby's left you any.

57:55.104 --> 57:56.146
What?

57:56.355 --> 57:57.919
Nothing.

58:04.279 --> 58:07.928
Goodbye. Bye-bye.

58:12.828 --> 58:14.497
- Potter.
- I'm sorry, sir.

58:14.705 --> 58:17.312
I was just admiring your hourglass.

58:18.667 --> 58:20.127
Oh, yes.

58:20.648 --> 58:22.733
A most intriguing object.

58:23.359 --> 58:27.634
The sand runs in accordance
with the quality of the conversation.

58:27.947 --> 58:31.179
If it is stimulating, the sand runs slowly.

58:31.700 --> 58:33.577
- If it is not...
- I think I'll be going.

58:33.785 --> 58:37.122
Nonsense.
You have nothing to fear, dear boy.

58:37.226 --> 58:39.520
As to some of your classmates...

58:39.728 --> 58:43.065
...well, let's just say they're unlikely
to make the shelf.

58:43.273 --> 58:44.733
The shelf, sir?

58:45.359 --> 58:49.008
Anyone who aspires to be anyone
hopes to end up here.

58:49.112 --> 58:52.970
But then again, you already are someone,
aren't you, Harry?

58:54.534 --> 58:56.515
Did Voldemort ever make the shelf, sir?

58:58.704 --> 59:02.666
You knew him, didn't you, sir,
Tom Riddle? You were his teacher.

59:03.709 --> 59:07.254
Mr. Riddle had a number of teachers
whilst here at Hogwarts.

59:07.358 --> 59:08.922
What was he like?

59:12.676 --> 59:15.074
I'm sorry, sir. Forgive me.

59:15.699 --> 59:17.576
He killed my parents.

59:20.287 --> 59:21.538
Of course.

59:21.955 --> 59:24.979
It's only natural
you should want to know more.

59:27.064 --> 59:29.879
But I'm afraid I must disappoint you,
Harry.

59:30.818 --> 59:33.111
When I first met Mr. Riddle,
he was a quiet...

59:33.216 --> 59:37.490
...albeit brilliant, boy committed
to becoming a first-rate wizard.

59:37.699 --> 59:39.367
Not unlike others I've known.

59:39.993 --> 59:42.078
Not unlike yourself, in fact.

59:43.433 --> 59:45.519
If the monster existed...

59:46.040 --> 59:48.334
...it was buried deep within.

01:00:05.642 --> 01:00:07.101
Good luck, eh, Ron.

01:00:08.561 --> 01:00:10.959
- Nice hat!
- Ron, you're a loser.

01:00:11.168 --> 01:00:14.191
I'm counting on you, Ron.
I have two Galleons on Gryffindor, yeah?

01:00:14.400 --> 01:00:16.694
- Looking good, Ron.
- Loser!

01:00:18.987 --> 01:00:20.447
What's he wearing?

01:00:29.101 --> 01:00:30.873
So how was it, then?

01:00:32.125 --> 01:00:34.418
- How was what?
- Your dinner party?

01:00:34.627 --> 01:00:36.295
Pretty boring, actually.

01:00:37.025 --> 01:00:39.423
Though I think Harry enjoyed dessert.

01:00:42.759 --> 01:00:45.575
Slughorn's having a Christmas do,
you know.

01:00:45.679 --> 01:00:47.243
And we're meant to bring someone.

01:00:47.451 --> 01:00:51.101
I expect you'll be bringing McLaggen.
He's in the Slug Club, isn't he?

01:00:51.309 --> 01:00:54.124
- Actually, I was going to ask you.
- Really?

01:00:56.939 --> 01:00:59.025
Good luck today, Ron.

01:00:59.859 --> 01:01:02.153
I know you'll be brilliant.

01:01:05.176 --> 01:01:08.930
I'm resigning. After today's match,
McLaggen can have my spot.

01:01:09.138 --> 01:01:10.598
Have it your way.

01:01:10.806 --> 01:01:13.309
- Juice?
- Sure.

01:01:13.413 --> 01:01:15.185
Hello, everyone.

01:01:16.437 --> 01:01:18.522
You look dreadful, Ron.

01:01:18.626 --> 01:01:21.024
Is that why you put something
in his cup?

01:01:23.214 --> 01:01:24.882
Is it a tonic?

01:01:28.323 --> 01:01:29.991
Liquid luck.

01:01:31.346 --> 01:01:33.015
Don't drink it, Ron.

01:01:40.626 --> 01:01:43.962
- You could be expelled for that.
- I don't know what you're talking about.

01:01:46.152 --> 01:01:48.863
Come on, Harry.
We've got a game to win.

01:02:12.635 --> 01:02:14.512
Yes!

01:02:14.929 --> 01:02:17.848
Go on, Ron! Do it!

01:02:51.734 --> 01:02:54.027
Weasley! Weasley! Weasley!

01:02:54.549 --> 01:02:55.904
Yes!

01:02:56.008 --> 01:02:59.553
Weasley! Weasley! Weasley!

01:03:03.307 --> 01:03:04.871
Whoo!

01:03:05.079 --> 01:03:08.312
Yes. Whoo!

01:03:09.771 --> 01:03:14.880
Weasley! Weasley! Weasley!

01:03:19.155 --> 01:03:20.823
You really shouldn't have done it.

01:03:21.032 --> 01:03:26.036
I know. I suppose I could've
just used a Confundus Charm.

01:03:26.975 --> 01:03:31.667
That was different. That was tryouts.
This was an actual game.

01:03:34.377 --> 01:03:36.150
You didn't put it in.

01:03:37.818 --> 01:03:39.695
Ron only thought you did.

01:04:27.448 --> 01:04:30.784
Charms spell. I'm just practicing.

01:04:34.642 --> 01:04:36.519
Well, they're really good.

01:04:42.045 --> 01:04:44.026
How does it feel, Harry?

01:04:46.841 --> 01:04:50.073
When you see Dean with Ginny?

01:04:55.182 --> 01:04:56.641
I know.

01:04:57.684 --> 01:04:59.874
I see the way you look at her.

01:05:00.603 --> 01:05:02.167
You're my best friend.

01:05:11.343 --> 01:05:13.115
Oops.

01:05:14.575 --> 01:05:16.764
I think this room's taken.

01:05:18.537 --> 01:05:19.997
What's with the birds?

01:05:23.333 --> 01:05:25.105
Oppugno.

01:05:53.048 --> 01:05:54.821
It feels like this.

01:06:34.545 --> 01:06:37.569
Look, I can't help it
if she's got her knickers in a twist.

01:06:37.673 --> 01:06:42.782
What Lav and I have, well,
let's just say, there's no stopping it.

01:06:42.990 --> 01:06:44.346
It's chemical.

01:06:44.554 --> 01:06:48.933
Will it last? Who knows?
Point is, I'm a free agent.

01:06:49.038 --> 01:06:51.853
He's at perfect liberty
to kiss whoever he likes.

01:06:52.061 --> 01:06:54.459
I really couldn't care less.

01:06:54.668 --> 01:06:58.526
Was I under the impression he and I would
be attending Slughorn's Christmas party?

01:06:58.630 --> 01:07:00.194
Yes.

01:07:00.298 --> 01:07:04.782
Now, given the circumstances,
I've had to make other arrangements.

01:07:04.886 --> 01:07:06.137
Have you?

01:07:06.241 --> 01:07:08.326
Yes. Why?

01:07:08.431 --> 01:07:12.080
I just thought, seeing as neither of us
can go with who we'd really like to...

01:07:12.288 --> 01:07:14.478
...we should go together, as friends.

01:07:14.687 --> 01:07:16.251
Why didn't I think of that?

01:07:16.459 --> 01:07:18.023
Who are you going with?

01:07:18.127 --> 01:07:20.004
Um, it's a surprise.

01:07:20.108 --> 01:07:24.383
Anyway, it's you we've got to worry
about. You can't just take anyone.

01:07:25.009 --> 01:07:26.885
See that girl over there?

01:07:28.449 --> 01:07:33.141
That's Romilda Vane. Apparently she's
trying to smuggle you a love potion.

01:07:33.350 --> 01:07:34.809
Really?

01:07:35.852 --> 01:07:39.293
Hey! She's only interested in you because
she thinks you're the Chosen One.

01:07:39.397 --> 01:07:41.170
But I am the Chosen One.

01:07:41.274 --> 01:07:44.193
Okay, sorry. Um, kidding.

01:07:46.174 --> 01:07:47.634
I'll ask someone I like.

01:07:48.468 --> 01:07:50.032
Someone cool.

01:07:59.728 --> 01:08:02.752
I've never been to this part of the castle.

01:08:02.961 --> 01:08:06.193
At least not while awake.
I sleepwalk, you see.

01:08:06.401 --> 01:08:08.904
That's why I wear shoes to bed.

01:08:40.078 --> 01:08:43.102
Harmonia Nectere Passus.

01:08:55.614 --> 01:08:58.325
Harmonia Nectere Passus.

01:08:59.889 --> 01:09:02.599
Harmonia Nectere Passus.

01:09:17.196 --> 01:09:18.656
Drink?

01:09:19.490 --> 01:09:20.846
Neville.

01:09:21.054 --> 01:09:22.514
I didn't get into the Slug Club.

01:09:22.618 --> 01:09:25.746
It's okay, though. He's got Belby
handing out towels in the loo.

01:09:25.954 --> 01:09:28.770
- Oh, well, I'm fine, mate. Thanks.
- Okay.

01:09:39.196 --> 01:09:42.115
Hermione. What are you doing?
And what happened to you?

01:09:42.324 --> 01:09:47.641
I've just escaped.
I mean, left Cormac under the mistletoe.

01:09:47.746 --> 01:09:50.769
Cormac? That's who you invited?

01:09:50.978 --> 01:09:53.480
I thought it would annoy Ron the most.

01:09:54.314 --> 01:09:56.295
Thank you. I'll catch up with you later.

01:09:56.504 --> 01:09:59.527
He's got more tentacles
than a Snarfalump plant.

01:09:59.632 --> 01:10:01.821
- Dragon tartare?
- No, I'm fine. Thank you.

01:10:02.030 --> 01:10:04.636
Just as well.
They give one horribly bad breath.

01:10:04.845 --> 01:10:06.617
On second thoughts...

01:10:06.826 --> 01:10:08.807
Might keep Cormac at bay.

01:10:09.120 --> 01:10:12.039
Oh, God, here he comes.

01:10:14.646 --> 01:10:17.461
I think she just went to powder her nose.

01:10:17.669 --> 01:10:19.755
Slippery little minx, your friend.

01:10:19.963 --> 01:10:22.674
Likes to work her mouth too,
doesn't she?

01:10:25.698 --> 01:10:27.679
What is this I'm eating, by the way?

01:10:28.825 --> 01:10:30.494
Dragon balls.

01:10:41.650 --> 01:10:44.778
You've just bought yourself
a month's detention, McLaggen.

01:10:44.986 --> 01:10:48.844
Not so quick, Potter.

01:10:50.408 --> 01:10:53.536
Sir, I really think I should
rejoin the party. My date...

01:10:53.744 --> 01:10:57.602
Can surely survive your absence
for another minute or two.

01:10:57.811 --> 01:11:00.000
Besides, I only wish
to convey a message.

01:11:00.626 --> 01:11:02.920
- A message?
- From Professor Dumbledore.

01:11:03.128 --> 01:11:06.777
He asked me to give you his best,
and he hopes you enjoy your holiday.

01:11:06.882 --> 01:11:08.446
You see...

01:11:08.654 --> 01:11:14.180
...he's traveling, and he won't
return until term resumes.

01:11:14.389 --> 01:11:15.848
Traveling where?

01:11:23.981 --> 01:11:25.858
Take your hands off me, you filthy Squib!

01:11:27.005 --> 01:11:28.777
Professor Slughorn, sir.

01:11:28.881 --> 01:11:33.260
I just discovered this boy
lurking in an upstairs corridor.

01:11:33.365 --> 01:11:35.450
He claims to have been
invited to your party.

01:11:35.658 --> 01:11:38.891
Okay, okay. I was gatecrashing. Happy?

01:11:39.516 --> 01:11:43.270
I'll escort him out.

01:11:46.085 --> 01:11:49.734
Certainly, professor.

01:11:53.383 --> 01:11:56.615
All right, everyone, carry on, carry on.

01:11:58.701 --> 01:12:03.601
Maybe I did hex that Bell girl.
Maybe I didn't. What's it to you?

01:12:03.810 --> 01:12:05.895
I swore to protect you.

01:12:06.103 --> 01:12:09.440
I made the Unbreakable Vow.

01:12:09.544 --> 01:12:11.734
I don't need protection.

01:12:11.942 --> 01:12:16.113
I was chosen for this.
Out of all others. Me.

01:12:17.051 --> 01:12:20.492
- And I won't fail him.
- You're afraid, Draco.

01:12:21.117 --> 01:12:25.079
You attempt to conceal it,
but it's obvious. Let me assist you.

01:12:25.184 --> 01:12:26.643
No!

01:12:27.060 --> 01:12:30.397
I was chosen. This is my moment.

01:12:42.909 --> 01:12:44.472
"Unbreakable Vow."

01:12:44.577 --> 01:12:46.245
You're sure that's what Snape said?

01:12:46.453 --> 01:12:48.643
Positive. Why?

01:12:48.852 --> 01:12:52.397
Well, it's just you can't break
an Unbreakable Vow.

01:12:52.501 --> 01:12:55.837
I'd worked that much out for myself,
funnily enough.

01:12:56.359 --> 01:12:58.131
You don't understand.

01:12:58.757 --> 01:12:59.799
Oh, bloody hell.

01:13:27.638 --> 01:13:29.514
I miss you.

01:13:31.287 --> 01:13:32.851
Lovely.

01:13:32.955 --> 01:13:36.292
All she wants to do is snog me.
My lips are getting chapped. Look.

01:13:36.500 --> 01:13:38.690
I'll take your word for it.

01:13:48.803 --> 01:13:53.704
So, what happens to you? What happens
if you break an Unbreakable Vow?

01:13:54.225 --> 01:13:55.997
You die.

01:14:00.585 --> 01:14:02.462
Wait, the pudding's still here.

01:14:03.713 --> 01:14:07.049
Voldemort has chosen
Draco Malfoy for a mission?

01:14:07.154 --> 01:14:08.300
I know it sounds mad.

01:14:08.405 --> 01:14:11.950
Has it occurred to you Snape was
simply pretending to offer Draco help...

01:14:12.158 --> 01:14:14.556
...so he could find out
what he was up to?

01:14:14.765 --> 01:14:17.788
- That's not what it sounded like.
- Perhaps Harry's right.

01:14:18.310 --> 01:14:19.978
To make an Unbreakable Vow, it's...

01:14:20.082 --> 01:14:23.627
It comes down to whether or not
you trust Dumbledore's judgment.

01:14:23.836 --> 01:14:27.902
- Dumbledore trusts Snape, therefore I do.
- Dumbledore can make mistakes.

01:14:28.006 --> 01:14:29.153
You're blinded by hatred.

01:14:29.362 --> 01:14:31.447
- I'm not.
- Yes, you are.

01:14:33.219 --> 01:14:36.139
People are disappearing, Harry, daily.

01:14:36.347 --> 01:14:38.328
We place our trust
in a handful of people.

01:14:38.433 --> 01:14:41.456
If we start fighting amongst ourselves,
we're doomed.

01:15:05.958 --> 01:15:07.418
Open up, you.

01:15:09.086 --> 01:15:10.754
Don't you trust me?

01:15:17.010 --> 01:15:18.053
It's good.

01:15:18.991 --> 01:15:21.806
Yeah, I'll just... Get... Yeah.

01:15:28.583 --> 01:15:31.399
- Pie?
- Not for me, no.

01:15:43.285 --> 01:15:44.849
You'll have to forgive Remus.

01:15:45.161 --> 01:15:47.976
It takes its toll, his condition.

01:15:48.915 --> 01:15:50.896
Are you all right, Mr. Weasley?

01:15:51.104 --> 01:15:53.607
We're being followed, all of us.

01:15:53.815 --> 01:15:56.318
Most days,
Molly doesn't leave the house.

01:15:57.152 --> 01:15:59.237
It's not been easy.

01:16:01.218 --> 01:16:02.573
Did you get my owl?

01:16:02.782 --> 01:16:04.867
Yes, I did.

01:16:06.431 --> 01:16:09.455
If Dumbledore's traveling,
then that's news to the Ministry...

01:16:09.559 --> 01:16:12.061
...but perhaps that's the way
Dumbledore wants it.

01:16:12.791 --> 01:16:15.294
As for Draco Malfoy...

01:16:15.919 --> 01:16:17.066
...I know a bit more.

01:16:17.692 --> 01:16:20.715
- Go on.
- I sent an agent to Borgin and Burkes.

01:16:20.924 --> 01:16:23.218
I think, from what you described...

01:16:23.426 --> 01:16:25.094
...what you and Ron saw in summer...

01:16:25.199 --> 01:16:28.744
...the object
that Draco is so interested in...

01:16:28.952 --> 01:16:30.412
...is a vanishing cabinet.

01:16:31.246 --> 01:16:32.601
A vanishing cabinet?

01:16:32.706 --> 01:16:36.772
They were all the rage
when Voldemort first rose to power.

01:16:36.876 --> 01:16:39.900
You can see the appeal.
Should Death Eaters come knocking...

01:16:40.004 --> 01:16:44.800
...one simply had to slip inside
and disappear for an hour or two.

01:16:45.426 --> 01:16:47.198
They can transport you anywhere.

01:16:47.303 --> 01:16:50.743
Tricky contraptions though,
very temperamental.

01:16:50.847 --> 01:16:53.767
What happened to it?
The one at Borgin and Burkes?

01:16:53.975 --> 01:16:55.122
Nothing.

01:16:55.956 --> 01:16:57.625
It's still there.

01:17:08.781 --> 01:17:10.449
It was delicious, Molly, really.

01:17:10.658 --> 01:17:11.909
Are you sure you won't stay?

01:17:12.117 --> 01:17:16.496
No, we should go. The first night
of the cycle's always the worst.

01:17:16.705 --> 01:17:17.643
Remus?

01:17:26.610 --> 01:17:28.174
Sweetheart.

01:17:36.515 --> 01:17:38.183
Has Ron gone to bed?

01:17:38.392 --> 01:17:41.207
Um... Not yet. No.

01:17:42.979 --> 01:17:44.335
Shoelace.

01:17:56.951 --> 01:17:58.827
Merry Christmas, Harry.

01:18:00.287 --> 01:18:01.747
Merry Christmas.

01:18:19.055 --> 01:18:21.348
- Harry, no!
- Remus!

01:18:31.149 --> 01:18:32.609
Ginny!

01:18:35.737 --> 01:18:40.429
I killed Sirius Black!
I killed Sirius Black!

01:18:40.637 --> 01:18:42.827
You coming to get me?

01:18:43.974 --> 01:18:47.310
Harry, can you get me?
You coming to get me?

01:19:17.025 --> 01:19:18.381
Harry?

01:19:35.897 --> 01:19:37.565
Stupefy!

01:20:00.399 --> 01:20:02.171
Harry!

01:20:15.726 --> 01:20:16.872
Ginny!

01:20:46.483 --> 01:20:47.943
Molly.

01:21:10.985 --> 01:21:12.653
It's easy for them to get to you.

01:21:12.862 --> 01:21:16.928
You're bloody lucky you weren't killed.
You have to realize who you are, Harry.

01:21:17.137 --> 01:21:19.639
I know who I am, Hermione, all right?

01:21:20.682 --> 01:21:21.829
Sorry.

01:21:23.497 --> 01:21:26.833
Lav, come on. Of course I'll wear it.

01:21:27.042 --> 01:21:29.127
That's my Won-Won.

01:21:31.212 --> 01:21:33.610
Excuse me, I have to go and vomit.

01:21:51.231 --> 01:21:53.525
I'd like to know
where you get your information.

01:21:53.733 --> 01:21:56.757
More knowledgeable
than half the staff, you are.

01:22:02.387 --> 01:22:03.951
Sir...

01:22:04.368 --> 01:22:07.183
...is it true
that Professor Merrythought is retiring?

01:22:07.392 --> 01:22:10.207
Now, Tom.
I couldn't tell you if I knew, could I?

01:22:10.416 --> 01:22:14.586
By the way, thank you for the pineapple.
You're quite right, it is my favorite.

01:22:15.212 --> 01:22:17.505
But how did you know?

01:22:19.278 --> 01:22:20.842
Intuition.

01:22:25.117 --> 01:22:26.785
Gracious. Is it that time already?

01:22:26.993 --> 01:22:30.643
Off you go, boys, or Professor Dippet
will have us all in detention.

01:22:34.709 --> 01:22:38.567
Look sharp, Tom. Don't want to be caught
out of bed after hours.

01:22:40.548 --> 01:22:42.529
- Is something on your mind, Tom?
- Yes, sir.

01:22:43.884 --> 01:22:46.699
You see, I couldn't think
of anyone else to go to.

01:22:47.638 --> 01:22:52.642
The other professors,
well, they're not like you.

01:22:53.059 --> 01:22:56.083
They might misunderstand.

01:22:56.292 --> 01:22:57.856
Go on.

01:22:58.690 --> 01:23:00.879
I was in the library the other night...

01:23:01.505 --> 01:23:03.694
...in the Restricted Section...

01:23:04.424 --> 01:23:07.969
...and I read something rather odd
about a bit of rare magic.

01:23:08.907 --> 01:23:12.348
And I thought perhaps
you could illuminate me.

01:23:12.557 --> 01:23:15.372
It's called, as I understand it...

01:23:18.291 --> 01:23:19.438
I beg your pardon?

01:23:19.647 --> 01:23:23.192
I don't know anything about such things,
and if I did, I wouldn't tell you!

01:23:23.400 --> 01:23:28.196
Now, get out of here at once, and don't
let me ever catch you mentioning it again!

01:23:31.116 --> 01:23:32.263
Confused?

01:23:32.992 --> 01:23:34.452
I'd be surprised if you weren't.

01:23:35.390 --> 01:23:38.101
Well, I don't understand.
What happened?

01:23:38.310 --> 01:23:41.959
This is perhaps the most important
memory I've collected.

01:23:42.272 --> 01:23:44.044
It is also a lie.

01:23:44.983 --> 01:23:46.755
This memory has been tampered with...

01:23:46.964 --> 01:23:51.343
...by the same person whose memory it is,
our old friend, Professor Slughorn.

01:23:51.968 --> 01:23:53.949
But why would he tamper
with his own memory?

01:23:54.158 --> 01:23:56.973
- I suspect he's ashamed of it.
- Why?

01:23:57.182 --> 01:23:58.641
Why, indeed?

01:23:59.475 --> 01:24:02.812
I asked you to get to know
Professor Slughorn, and you have done so.

01:24:03.020 --> 01:24:06.565
Now I want you to persuade him
to divulge his true memory...

01:24:06.774 --> 01:24:08.338
...any way you can.

01:24:08.546 --> 01:24:10.423
I don't know him that well, sir.

01:24:14.906 --> 01:24:17.826
This memory is everything.

01:24:18.347 --> 01:24:20.328
Without it, we are blind.

01:24:20.849 --> 01:24:24.499
Without it, we leave the fate
of our world to chance.

01:24:26.480 --> 01:24:28.356
You have no choice.

01:24:29.608 --> 01:24:31.589
You must not fail.

01:24:39.617 --> 01:24:42.015
So I'd highly recommend
you reacquaint yourself...

01:24:42.119 --> 01:24:43.579
...with the chapter on antidotes.

01:24:43.787 --> 01:24:47.541
I'll tell you more about bezoars
in our next class. Right, off you go.

01:24:47.749 --> 01:24:50.147
Alys, don't forget your rat tail.

01:24:55.673 --> 01:24:59.427
Aha. If it isn't
the Prince of Potions himself.

01:24:59.635 --> 01:25:01.512
To what do I owe this pleasure?

01:25:02.763 --> 01:25:04.744
Sir, I wondered
if I might ask you something.

01:25:04.953 --> 01:25:07.247
Ask away, dear boy, ask away.

01:25:07.351 --> 01:25:10.375
The other day I was in the library,
in the Restricted Section...

01:25:10.583 --> 01:25:14.232
...and I came across something rather odd
about a very rare piece of magic.

01:25:15.588 --> 01:25:18.194
Yes. And what was this
rare piece of magic?

01:25:18.403 --> 01:25:21.739
Well, I don't know.
I can't remember the name exactly.

01:25:21.948 --> 01:25:26.223
It got me wondering, are there some kinds
of magic you're not allowed to teach us?

01:25:28.204 --> 01:25:29.559
I'm Potions Master, Harry.

01:25:29.768 --> 01:25:32.583
I think your question'd
better be posed to Professor Snape.

01:25:32.791 --> 01:25:34.668
Yes. Um...

01:25:34.877 --> 01:25:37.275
He and I don't exactly
see eye to eye, sir.

01:25:37.483 --> 01:25:39.256
What I mean to say is...

01:25:40.090 --> 01:25:41.862
...well, he's not like you.

01:25:42.592 --> 01:25:44.365
He might misunderstand.

01:25:45.720 --> 01:25:49.578
Yes. There can be no light
without the dark.

01:25:49.682 --> 01:25:53.748
And so it is with magic. Myself, I always
strive to live within the light.

01:25:54.374 --> 01:25:56.042
I suggest you do the same.

01:25:56.459 --> 01:25:59.379
Is that what you told Tom Riddle,
when he came asking questions?

01:26:06.364 --> 01:26:09.388
Dumbledore put you up to this,
didn't he?

01:26:11.473 --> 01:26:13.037
Didn't he?

01:26:20.440 --> 01:26:21.691
Yes?

01:26:22.108 --> 01:26:24.193
Oh, it's you, Potter.

01:26:24.402 --> 01:26:26.800
I'm sorry, I'm busy at the moment.

01:26:39.624 --> 01:26:43.378
It's beautiful, isn't it? The moon.

01:26:44.420 --> 01:26:45.776
Divine.

01:26:46.506 --> 01:26:48.800
Had ourselves a little
late-night snack, did we?

01:26:49.946 --> 01:26:53.491
It was on your bed, the box.
I just thought I'd try one.

01:26:53.700 --> 01:26:57.141
- Or 20.
- I can't stop thinking about her, Harry.

01:26:57.349 --> 01:26:59.330
Honestly, I reckoned
she was annoying you.

01:26:59.539 --> 01:27:01.832
She could never annoy me.

01:27:03.605 --> 01:27:05.169
I think I love her.

01:27:08.714 --> 01:27:11.008
Well, brilliant.

01:27:14.865 --> 01:27:16.534
Do you think she knows I exist?

01:27:16.638 --> 01:27:19.140
I hope so. She's been snogging you
for three months.

01:27:19.349 --> 01:27:22.268
Snogging? Who are you talking about?

01:27:23.207 --> 01:27:24.458
Who are you talking about?

01:27:25.188 --> 01:27:28.837
Romilda, of course. Romilda Vane.

01:27:29.045 --> 01:27:30.505
Okay, very funny.

01:27:33.633 --> 01:27:37.282
- What was that for?
- It's no joke! I'm in love with her!

01:27:37.491 --> 01:27:40.306
Fine, you're in love with her.
Have you ever actually met her?

01:27:41.348 --> 01:27:44.268
No. Can you introduce me?

01:28:05.955 --> 01:28:10.751
Come on, Ron. I'm gonna introduce you
to Romilda Vane.

01:28:21.490 --> 01:28:25.139
I'm sorry, sir. I wouldn't bother you
if it weren't absolutely essential.

01:28:26.077 --> 01:28:27.433
Where's Romilda?

01:28:27.641 --> 01:28:29.518
What's the matter with Wenby?

01:28:30.040 --> 01:28:31.916
Very powerful love potion.

01:28:32.125 --> 01:28:34.419
Very well. Better bring him in.

01:28:34.627 --> 01:28:37.859
I'd have thought you could whip up
a remedy for this in no time, Harry.

01:28:38.068 --> 01:28:40.987
Well, I thought this called
for a more practiced hand, sir.

01:28:41.196 --> 01:28:44.219
Hello, darling. Fancy a drink?

01:28:44.428 --> 01:28:46.096
Perhaps you're right.

01:28:50.579 --> 01:28:56.001
I'm sorry, by the way, professor,
about earlier today, our misunderstanding.

01:28:56.210 --> 01:29:00.589
Oh, not at all. All water
under the bridge, you know? Correct?

01:29:00.693 --> 01:29:03.612
I expect you're tired of it
after all these years.

01:29:03.821 --> 01:29:06.428
All the questions about Voldemort.

01:29:06.532 --> 01:29:08.409
Don't use that name.

01:29:16.124 --> 01:29:18.209
There you are, old boy. Bottoms up.

01:29:18.418 --> 01:29:21.441
- What's this?
- Tonic for the nerves.

01:29:36.038 --> 01:29:38.332
- What happened to me?
- Love potion.

01:29:38.436 --> 01:29:40.626
A bloody strong one at that.

01:29:41.147 --> 01:29:44.797
- I feel really bad.
- You need a pick-me-up.

01:29:45.005 --> 01:29:48.654
Got Butterbeer,
wine, dazzling oak-matured mead.

01:29:48.863 --> 01:29:53.138
I had other intentions for this,
but I think, given the circumstances...

01:29:55.431 --> 01:29:57.100
Here we are, Potter.

01:29:57.308 --> 01:29:58.768
To life!

01:30:03.668 --> 01:30:04.607
Ron.

01:30:07.109 --> 01:30:10.550
Ron. Professor, do something.

01:30:11.697 --> 01:30:13.261
I don't understand.

01:30:29.734 --> 01:30:31.507
Come on, Ron, breathe.

01:30:53.715 --> 01:30:56.530
These girls, they're gonna kill me.

01:31:07.582 --> 01:31:10.918
Quick thinking on your part, Harry,
using a bezoar.

01:31:11.127 --> 01:31:13.421
You must be very proud
of your student, Horace.

01:31:13.629 --> 01:31:17.070
Hm? Oh, yes, very proud.

01:31:17.278 --> 01:31:19.989
I think we agree,
Potter's actions were heroic.

01:31:20.198 --> 01:31:24.160
The question is,
why were they necessary?

01:31:24.368 --> 01:31:26.037
Why, indeed?

01:31:26.245 --> 01:31:28.226
This appears to be a gift, Horace.

01:31:28.539 --> 01:31:31.354
You don't remember
who gave you this bottle?

01:31:31.563 --> 01:31:35.525
Which, by the way, possesses remarkably
subtle hints of licorice and cherry...

01:31:35.733 --> 01:31:38.131
...when not polluted with poison.

01:31:38.340 --> 01:31:41.468
Actually I had intended
to give it as a gift myself.

01:31:41.676 --> 01:31:43.032
To whom, I might ask?

01:31:44.804 --> 01:31:46.994
To you, Headmaster.

01:31:49.392 --> 01:31:50.434
Where is he?

01:31:50.643 --> 01:31:54.709
Where's my Won-Won?
Has he been asking for me?

01:31:57.733 --> 01:31:59.401
What's she doing here?

01:31:59.609 --> 01:32:01.799
I might ask you the same question.

01:32:02.008 --> 01:32:04.301
I happen to be his girlfriend.

01:32:04.406 --> 01:32:07.221
I happen to be his friend.

01:32:07.325 --> 01:32:11.600
Don't make me laugh.
You haven't spoken in weeks.

01:32:12.330 --> 01:32:15.249
I suppose you want to make up
now that he's all interesting.

01:32:15.458 --> 01:32:19.107
He's been poisoned, you daft dimbo!

01:32:19.315 --> 01:32:22.130
And for the record,
I've always found him interesting.

01:32:23.799 --> 01:32:28.803
Ah. See? He senses my presence.

01:32:29.012 --> 01:32:32.244
Don't worry, Won-Won. I'm here.

01:32:32.974 --> 01:32:34.746
I'm here.

01:32:40.689 --> 01:32:43.817
Uh... Hermione...

01:32:47.884 --> 01:32:49.865
Hermione.

01:32:50.699 --> 01:32:52.888
Hermione.

01:33:00.499 --> 01:33:04.357
Oh, to be young,
and to feel love's keen sting.

01:33:04.774 --> 01:33:07.068
Well, come away, everybody.

01:33:07.277 --> 01:33:09.883
Mr. Weasley is well tended.

01:33:14.158 --> 01:33:16.660
About time, don't you think?

01:33:19.371 --> 01:33:20.935
Thank you.

01:33:23.854 --> 01:33:25.627
Oh, shut up.

01:35:37.938 --> 01:35:41.795
Stop it, Ron. You're making it snow.

01:35:46.279 --> 01:35:48.885
Tell me how I broke up
with Lavender again.

01:35:49.719 --> 01:35:52.534
Um, well...

01:35:52.743 --> 01:35:55.767
...she came to visit you
in the hospital.

01:35:56.601 --> 01:35:58.999
And you talked.

01:36:00.667 --> 01:36:04.733
I don't believe it was
a particularly long conversation.

01:36:04.838 --> 01:36:08.174
Don't get me wrong, I'm bloody thrilled
to be shot of her.

01:36:08.383 --> 01:36:10.676
It's just she seems a bit put out.

01:36:17.141 --> 01:36:20.686
Yes, she does, doesn't she?

01:36:22.354 --> 01:36:27.358
You say you don't remember
anything from that night?

01:36:27.567 --> 01:36:30.486
Anything at all?

01:36:30.695 --> 01:36:32.467
There is something.

01:36:36.012 --> 01:36:40.496
But it can't be.
I was completely boggled, wasn't I?

01:36:41.955 --> 01:36:45.188
Right. Boggled.

01:36:52.486 --> 01:36:53.737
Harry.

01:36:55.197 --> 01:36:56.344
That's Katie.

01:36:58.325 --> 01:36:59.889
Katie Bell.

01:37:07.604 --> 01:37:10.002
Katie. How are you?

01:37:10.628 --> 01:37:15.111
I know you're going to ask, Harry,
but I don't know who cursed me.

01:37:16.779 --> 01:37:20.324
I've been trying to remember, honestly.

01:37:20.741 --> 01:37:24.182
But I just can't.

01:37:37.424 --> 01:37:38.779
Katie?

01:38:21.214 --> 01:38:25.281
I know what you did, Malfoy.
You hexed her, didn't you?

01:38:55.621 --> 01:38:57.602
Sectumsempra!

01:39:44.625 --> 01:39:47.545
Vulnera Sanentur.

01:39:49.213 --> 01:39:52.028
Vulnera Sanentur.

01:39:54.322 --> 01:39:57.241
Vulnera Sanentur.

01:40:18.302 --> 01:40:21.847
You have to get rid of it. Today.

01:40:26.748 --> 01:40:28.312
Take my hand.

01:40:44.368 --> 01:40:46.245
The Room of Requirement.

01:40:52.709 --> 01:40:55.316
We need to hide
the Half-Blood Prince's book...

01:40:55.525 --> 01:40:59.174
...where no one will ever find it,
including you.

01:41:07.619 --> 01:41:08.975
- What was that?
- What was that?

01:41:35.145 --> 01:41:36.500
See?

01:41:37.022 --> 01:41:39.003
You never know what you'll find up here.

01:41:58.187 --> 01:42:02.149
All right, close your eyes.
That way you can't be tempted.

01:42:06.007 --> 01:42:07.675
Close your eyes.

01:42:34.367 --> 01:42:37.182
That can stay hidden up here too,
if you like.

01:42:51.883 --> 01:42:54.281
So did you and Ginny do it, then?

01:42:54.385 --> 01:42:55.532
What?

01:42:55.741 --> 01:42:57.826
You know, hide the book?

01:42:58.034 --> 01:42:59.911
Oh, yeah.

01:43:02.831 --> 01:43:05.333
Ah. Dear, yes.

01:43:05.541 --> 01:43:08.356
Still no luck with Slughorn, then,
I take it?

01:43:10.442 --> 01:43:11.693
Luck.

01:43:12.736 --> 01:43:16.072
That's it. All I need's a bit of luck.

01:43:34.214 --> 01:43:37.446
Well, how do you feel?

01:43:37.655 --> 01:43:39.219
Excellent.

01:43:40.470 --> 01:43:42.451
Really excellent.

01:43:45.162 --> 01:43:46.726
Remember...

01:43:47.143 --> 01:43:48.811
...Slughorn usually eats early...

01:43:49.019 --> 01:43:52.043
...takes a walk,
and then returns to his office.

01:43:52.147 --> 01:43:53.711
Right.

01:43:54.128 --> 01:43:56.214
- I'm going down to Hagrid's.
- What?

01:43:56.422 --> 01:43:59.133
No, Harry, you've got to go
and speak to Slughorn.

01:44:00.697 --> 01:44:03.303
- We have a plan.
- I know...

01:44:03.408 --> 01:44:05.493
...but I've got a
good feeling about Hagrid's.

01:44:05.701 --> 01:44:09.455
I feel it's the place to be tonight.
Do you know what I mean?

01:44:10.289 --> 01:44:12.583
- No.
- Well, trust me, I know what I'm doing.

01:44:12.791 --> 01:44:14.877
Or Felix does.

01:44:16.024 --> 01:44:17.483
Hi!

01:44:48.137 --> 01:44:49.805
Merlin's beard, Harry!

01:44:50.014 --> 01:44:54.184
Sorry, sir. I should've announced myself.
Cleared my throat, coughed.

01:44:54.288 --> 01:44:56.269
You probably feared
I was Professor Sprout.

01:44:56.478 --> 01:44:59.814
Yes, I did, actually.
What makes you think that?

01:45:00.023 --> 01:45:02.108
Well, just the general behavior, sir.

01:45:02.317 --> 01:45:05.028
The sneaking around,
the jumping when you saw me.

01:45:05.236 --> 01:45:08.781
Are those Tentacula leaves, sir?
They're very valuable, aren't they?

01:45:08.990 --> 01:45:11.283
Ten Galleons a leaf to the right buyer.

01:45:11.492 --> 01:45:15.037
Not that I'm familiar with any such
transactions, but one does hear rumors.

01:45:15.141 --> 01:45:18.999
My own interests
are purely academic, of course.

01:45:19.103 --> 01:45:22.440
Personally, these plants
always kind of freaked me out.

01:45:25.672 --> 01:45:27.861
How did you get out of the castle, Harry?

01:45:28.070 --> 01:45:29.529
Through the front door, sir.

01:45:29.738 --> 01:45:31.823
I'm off to Hagrid's.
He's a very dear friend...

01:45:32.032 --> 01:45:33.700
...and I fancied paying him a visit.

01:45:33.909 --> 01:45:36.202
So if you don't mind,
I will be going now.

01:45:37.036 --> 01:45:38.600
Harry!

01:45:39.435 --> 01:45:41.937
- Sir?
- It's nearly nightfall.

01:45:42.041 --> 01:45:45.482
Surely you realize I can't allow you
to go roaming the grounds by yourself.

01:45:45.690 --> 01:45:48.297
Well, then, by all means, come along, sir.

01:45:53.614 --> 01:45:56.847
Harry, I must insist
you accompany me...

01:45:57.055 --> 01:45:58.723
...back to the castle immediately!

01:45:58.932 --> 01:46:02.164
That would be counterproductive, sir.

01:46:03.519 --> 01:46:05.605
And what makes you say that?

01:46:06.752 --> 01:46:08.316
No idea.

01:46:15.093 --> 01:46:16.448
Horace.

01:46:17.074 --> 01:46:22.391
Merlin's beard.
Is that an actual Acromantula?

01:46:23.017 --> 01:46:25.102
A dead one, I think, sir.

01:46:25.832 --> 01:46:27.396
Good God.

01:46:28.021 --> 01:46:31.149
Dear fellow,
however did you manage to kill it?

01:46:31.462 --> 01:46:34.903
Kill it? Me oldest friend, he was.

01:46:35.007 --> 01:46:39.282
- I'm so sorry, I didn't...
- Don't worry yourself, you're not alone.

01:46:39.803 --> 01:46:43.244
Seriously misunderstood creatures,
spiders are.

01:46:43.348 --> 01:46:45.538
It's the eyes, I reckon.
They unnerve some folk.

01:46:46.059 --> 01:46:47.936
Not to mention the pincers.

01:46:52.315 --> 01:46:54.192
Yeah, I reckon that too.

01:46:54.921 --> 01:46:58.258
Hagrid, the last thing
I wish to be is indelicate...

01:46:58.466 --> 01:47:02.533
...but Acromantular venom
is uncommonly rare.

01:47:02.741 --> 01:47:04.931
Would you allow me
to extract a vial or two?

01:47:05.139 --> 01:47:07.746
Purely for academic purposes,
you understand.

01:47:07.954 --> 01:47:10.769
Well, I don't suppose it's going
to do him much good now, is it?

01:47:10.978 --> 01:47:12.229
My thoughts exactly.

01:47:12.333 --> 01:47:18.902
Always have a ampoule or two about
my person for just such occasions as this.

01:47:19.111 --> 01:47:24.115
Old Potions Master's habit, you know.

01:47:24.845 --> 01:47:27.243
I wish you could've seen him
in his prime.

01:47:27.452 --> 01:47:31.101
Magnificent, he was. Just magnificent.

01:47:32.561 --> 01:47:34.125
Oh, dear.

01:47:43.821 --> 01:47:47.053
- Would you like me to say a few words?
- Yes.

01:47:47.262 --> 01:47:48.826
He had a family, I trust?

01:47:49.034 --> 01:47:50.494
Oh, yeah.

01:47:55.811 --> 01:47:57.271
Farewell...

01:47:57.480 --> 01:47:59.356
Aragog.

01:48:03.840 --> 01:48:06.759
Farewell, Aragog...

01:48:07.176 --> 01:48:09.887
...king of the arachnids.

01:48:10.721 --> 01:48:13.223
Your body will decay...

01:48:14.475 --> 01:48:17.290
...but your spirit lingers on.

01:48:18.020 --> 01:48:24.692
And your human friends find solace
in the loss they have sustained.

01:48:39.915 --> 01:48:43.460
I had him from an egg, you know.
Tiny little thing he was when he hatched.

01:48:43.668 --> 01:48:47.318
No bigger than a Pekinese.
A Pekinese, mind you.

01:48:47.526 --> 01:48:52.739
How sweet. I once had a fish. Francis.
He was very dear to me.

01:48:52.844 --> 01:48:58.057
One afternoon I came downstairs,
and he'd vanished.

01:48:58.265 --> 01:48:59.829
Poof.

01:48:59.934 --> 01:49:03.166
- That's very odd, isn't it?
- It is, isn't it?

01:49:03.374 --> 01:49:07.023
But that's life, I suppose.

01:49:07.232 --> 01:49:12.549
You go along and then suddenly, poof!

01:49:12.758 --> 01:49:16.407
- Poof.
- Poof.

01:49:31.004 --> 01:49:34.028
It was a student who gave me Francis.

01:49:35.070 --> 01:49:39.345
One spring afternoon
I discovered a bowl on my desk...

01:49:40.284 --> 01:49:43.203
...with just a few inches
of clear water in it.

01:49:44.037 --> 01:49:47.582
And floating on the surface
was a flower petal.

01:49:49.146 --> 01:49:51.544
As I watched, it sank.

01:49:53.108 --> 01:49:55.923
Just before it reached the bottom...

01:49:56.132 --> 01:49:57.591
...it transformed...

01:49:58.947 --> 01:50:00.719
...into a wee fish.

01:50:02.492 --> 01:50:04.577
It was beautiful magic.

01:50:05.620 --> 01:50:07.809
Wondrous to behold.

01:50:10.416 --> 01:50:13.231
The flower petal had come from a lily.

01:50:15.629 --> 01:50:16.567
Your mother.

01:50:18.653 --> 01:50:21.155
The day I came downstairs...

01:50:22.093 --> 01:50:24.387
...the day the bowl was empty...

01:50:25.951 --> 01:50:28.141
...was the day your mother...

01:50:32.103 --> 01:50:34.084
I know why you're here.

01:50:37.107 --> 01:50:39.088
But I can't help you.

01:50:40.965 --> 01:50:42.633
It would ruin me.

01:50:46.387 --> 01:50:48.785
Do you know why I survived, professor?

01:50:49.410 --> 01:50:51.183
The night I got this?

01:50:52.955 --> 01:50:54.519
Because of her.

01:50:55.458 --> 01:50:57.230
Because she sacrificed herself.

01:50:57.751 --> 01:51:00.045
Because she refused to step aside.

01:51:00.254 --> 01:51:03.486
Because her love was more powerful
than Voldemort.

01:51:03.590 --> 01:51:07.344
- Don't say his name.
- I'm not afraid of the name, professor.

01:51:08.178 --> 01:51:10.263
I'm going to tell you something.

01:51:11.201 --> 01:51:14.121
Something others have only guessed at.

01:51:16.102 --> 01:51:17.666
It's true.

01:51:18.187 --> 01:51:19.543
I am the Chosen One.

01:51:20.481 --> 01:51:22.670
Only I can destroy him,
but in order to do so...

01:51:22.879 --> 01:51:26.215
...I need to know what Tom Riddle
asked you years ago in your office...

01:51:26.320 --> 01:51:28.718
...and I need to know what you told him.

01:51:29.448 --> 01:51:31.846
Be brave, professor.

01:51:33.514 --> 01:51:35.599
Be brave like my mother.

01:51:36.850 --> 01:51:39.561
Otherwise, you disgrace her.

01:51:40.708 --> 01:51:42.898
Otherwise, she died for nothing.

01:51:43.940 --> 01:51:49.153
Otherwise, the bowl
will remain empty forever.

01:51:59.684 --> 01:52:02.812
Please, don't think badly of me
when you see it.

01:52:04.897 --> 01:52:08.129
You've no idea what he was like,
even then.

01:52:44.934 --> 01:52:47.541
I was in the library the other night...

01:52:47.750 --> 01:52:49.939
...in the Restricted Section...

01:52:50.773 --> 01:52:54.422
...and I read something rather odd
about a bit of rare magic.

01:52:55.778 --> 01:52:58.489
It's called, as I understand it...

01:52:59.740 --> 01:53:01.095
...a Horcrux.

01:53:02.972 --> 01:53:05.683
- I beg your pardon?
- Horcrux.

01:53:06.100 --> 01:53:08.811
I came across the term while reading...

01:53:08.915 --> 01:53:11.939
...and I didn't fully understand it.

01:53:12.147 --> 01:53:13.816
I'm not sure what you
were reading, Tom...

01:53:14.024 --> 01:53:16.631
...but this is very dark stuff,
very dark indeed.

01:53:16.839 --> 01:53:18.299
Which is...

01:53:19.446 --> 01:53:21.322
...why I came to you.

01:53:24.138 --> 01:53:29.768
A Horcrux is an object in which a person
has concealed part of their soul.

01:53:29.976 --> 01:53:32.583
But I don't understand
how that works, sir.

01:53:35.190 --> 01:53:39.152
One splits one's soul and hides
part of it in an object.

01:53:39.360 --> 01:53:42.905
By doing so, you're protected, should
you be attacked and your body destroyed.

01:53:43.114 --> 01:53:44.260
Protected?

01:53:44.365 --> 01:53:47.597
That part of your soul
that is hidden lives on.

01:53:49.057 --> 01:53:51.455
In other words, you cannot die.

01:53:58.649 --> 01:54:01.777
And how does one split his soul, sir?

01:54:01.985 --> 01:54:04.800
I think you already know
the answer to that, Tom.

01:54:06.052 --> 01:54:07.511
Murder.

01:54:08.033 --> 01:54:09.284
Yes.

01:54:09.909 --> 01:54:14.810
Killing rips the soul apart.
It is a violation against nature.

01:54:15.644 --> 01:54:20.440
Can you only split the soul
once? For instance, isn't seven...?

01:54:20.649 --> 01:54:22.108
Seven?

01:54:22.838 --> 01:54:28.155
Merlin's beard, Tom. Isn't it bad enough
to consider killing one person?

01:54:28.364 --> 01:54:32.013
To rip the soul into seven pieces...

01:54:33.264 --> 01:54:36.288
This is all hypothetical, isn't it, Tom?
All academic?

01:54:41.084 --> 01:54:42.335
Of course, sir.

01:54:45.359 --> 01:54:47.340
It'll be our little secret.

01:54:56.098 --> 01:54:57.349
Sir.

01:55:12.780 --> 01:55:14.866
This is beyond anything I imagined.

01:55:15.074 --> 01:55:17.785
You mean to say he succeeded, sir,
in making a Horcrux?

01:55:17.889 --> 01:55:21.017
Oh, yes, he succeeded, all right.
And not just once.

01:55:21.226 --> 01:55:22.268
What are they exactly?

01:55:22.373 --> 01:55:25.709
Could be anything.
Most commonplace of objects.

01:55:28.941 --> 01:55:30.609
A ring, for example.

01:55:31.235 --> 01:55:32.695
Or a book.

01:55:34.050 --> 01:55:36.448
- Tom Riddle's diary.
- It's a Horcrux, yes.

01:55:36.969 --> 01:55:39.055
Four years ago, when you saved
Ginny's life...

01:55:39.263 --> 01:55:41.453
...in the Chamber of Secrets,
you brought me this.

01:55:41.661 --> 01:55:43.538
I knew this was
a different kind of magic.

01:55:43.747 --> 01:55:48.751
Very dark, very powerful. But until tonight
I had no idea just how powerful.

01:55:48.960 --> 01:55:50.941
- The ring?
- Belonged to Voldemort's mother.

01:55:51.358 --> 01:55:56.050
Difficult to find.
Even more difficult to destroy.

01:55:56.258 --> 01:56:00.116
But if you could find them all,
if you did destroy each Horcrux...

01:56:00.325 --> 01:56:01.471
One destroys Voldemort.

01:56:01.576 --> 01:56:04.495
But how would you find them?
They could be hidden anywhere.

01:56:04.704 --> 01:56:07.936
True. But magic, especially dark magic...

01:56:21.907 --> 01:56:23.784
...leaves traces.

01:56:31.604 --> 01:56:33.689
It's where you've been going,
isn't it, sir?

01:56:33.897 --> 01:56:36.087
- When you leave the school?
- Yes.

01:56:37.025 --> 01:56:40.049
And I think perhaps
I may have found another.

01:56:40.258 --> 01:56:44.324
But this time,
I cannot hope to destroy it alone.

01:56:45.888 --> 01:56:50.475
Once again,
I must ask too much of you, Harry.

01:56:54.542 --> 01:56:56.731
Have you ever considered
that you ask too much...

01:56:56.940 --> 01:56:59.546
...that you take too much for granted?

01:56:59.755 --> 01:57:04.759
Has it ever crossed your brilliant mind
that I don't want to do this anymore?

01:57:04.968 --> 01:57:07.053
Whether it has or hasn't is irrelevant.

01:57:07.992 --> 01:57:13.726
I will not negotiate with you, Severus.
You agreed. Nothing more to discuss.

01:57:32.181 --> 01:57:33.745
Oh, Harry.

01:57:36.351 --> 01:57:38.645
You need a shave, my friend.

01:57:41.460 --> 01:57:45.735
You know, at times,
I forget how much you've grown.

01:57:45.839 --> 01:57:49.801
At times, I still see the small boy
from the cupboard.

01:57:51.365 --> 01:57:53.763
Forgive my mawkishness, Harry.

01:57:54.180 --> 01:57:55.744
I'm an old man.

01:57:55.849 --> 01:57:57.517
You still look the same to me, sir.

01:57:58.977 --> 01:58:02.000
Just like your mother,
you're unfailingly kind.

01:58:02.209 --> 01:58:05.337
A trait people never fail to undervalue,
I'm afraid.

01:58:08.152 --> 01:58:12.635
The place to which we journey tonight
is extremely dangerous.

01:58:12.844 --> 01:58:16.284
I promised you could accompany me,
and I stand by that promise.

01:58:16.493 --> 01:58:18.265
But there is one condition:

01:58:18.474 --> 01:58:21.706
You must obey every command
I give you, without question.

01:58:22.540 --> 01:58:24.208
Yes, sir.

01:58:24.417 --> 01:58:26.502
You do understand what I'm saying?

01:58:27.128 --> 01:58:29.526
Should I tell you to hide, you hide.

01:58:29.734 --> 01:58:32.028
Should I tell you to run, you run.

01:58:32.237 --> 01:58:36.199
Should I tell you to abandon me
and save yourself, you must do so.

01:58:41.412 --> 01:58:42.976
Your word, Harry.

01:58:44.644 --> 01:58:46.104
My word.

01:58:46.938 --> 01:58:48.606
Take my arm.

01:58:50.066 --> 01:58:52.464
Sir, I thought you couldn't
Apparate within Hogwarts.

01:58:53.089 --> 01:58:56.530
Well, being me has its privileges.

01:59:43.866 --> 01:59:45.430
This is the place.

01:59:46.264 --> 01:59:47.828
Oh, yes.

01:59:48.766 --> 01:59:51.269
This place has known magic.

01:59:59.297 --> 02:00:00.861
- Sir!
- In order to gain passage...

02:00:01.069 --> 02:00:02.425
...payment must be made.

02:00:02.633 --> 02:00:06.282
Payment intended
to weaken any intruder.

02:00:07.846 --> 02:00:09.619
- You should've let me, sir.
- No, Harry.

02:00:10.140 --> 02:00:12.851
Your blood's much more precious
than mine.

02:00:34.746 --> 02:00:39.334
Voldemort will not have made it easy
to discover his hiding place.

02:00:39.543 --> 02:00:42.879
He will have put certain defenses
in position.

02:00:45.486 --> 02:00:46.841
Careful.

02:01:10.405 --> 02:01:11.552
There it is.

02:01:13.011 --> 02:01:15.722
The only question is,
how do we get there?

02:01:37.930 --> 02:01:39.703
If you would, Harry.

02:02:27.038 --> 02:02:29.436
Do you think the Horcrux is in there, sir?

02:02:30.062 --> 02:02:31.418
Oh, yes.

02:02:42.574 --> 02:02:44.138
It has to be drunk.

02:02:44.346 --> 02:02:47.161
All of it has to be drunk.

02:02:47.995 --> 02:02:51.332
You remember the conditions on which
I brought you with me?

02:02:51.540 --> 02:02:53.938
This potion might paralyze me.

02:02:54.356 --> 02:02:56.024
Might make me forget why I'm here.

02:02:56.754 --> 02:03:00.090
Might cause me so much pain
that I beg for relief.

02:03:00.299 --> 02:03:02.280
You are not to indulge these requests.

02:03:02.384 --> 02:03:05.929
It's your job, Harry, to make sure
I keep drinking this potion.

02:03:06.137 --> 02:03:08.535
Even if you have to force it
down my throat.

02:03:09.057 --> 02:03:11.142
- Understood?
- Why can't I drink it, sir?

02:03:11.350 --> 02:03:16.772
Because I am much older, much cleverer,
and much less valuable.

02:03:20.734 --> 02:03:22.715
Your good health, Harry.

02:03:38.876 --> 02:03:40.232
Professor.

02:03:42.317 --> 02:03:43.568
Professor!

02:03:50.241 --> 02:03:51.701
Harry.

02:03:51.909 --> 02:03:54.411
Professor, can you hear me?

02:03:55.663 --> 02:03:56.809
Professor.

02:04:12.240 --> 02:04:13.387
No. Don't.

02:04:13.596 --> 02:04:15.890
You have to keep drinking,
like you said. Remember?

02:04:25.169 --> 02:04:27.046
- Stop.
- It will stop. It will stop...

02:04:27.254 --> 02:04:31.633
...but only if you keep drinking.
- Please, don't make me.

02:04:31.842 --> 02:04:33.927
- I'm sorry, sir.
- Please.

02:04:34.136 --> 02:04:36.325
- Kill me. Kill me!
- No!

02:04:38.306 --> 02:04:39.349
It's my fault.

02:04:41.017 --> 02:04:42.268
It's all my fault.

02:04:44.145 --> 02:04:45.709
It's my fault.

02:04:45.918 --> 02:04:49.254
Just one more, sir.
One more, and then I promise...

02:04:49.984 --> 02:04:52.278
...I promise I'll do what you say.

02:04:52.486 --> 02:04:54.259
- I promise.
- No.

02:04:55.301 --> 02:04:56.657
Please.

02:05:20.846 --> 02:05:22.306
Harry.

02:05:29.396 --> 02:05:30.438
Water.

02:05:31.481 --> 02:05:32.628
Water.

02:05:32.732 --> 02:05:34.504
Water.

02:05:41.073 --> 02:05:42.846
You did it, sir.

02:05:43.054 --> 02:05:44.514
Look.

02:05:46.495 --> 02:05:47.746
Harry.

02:05:49.101 --> 02:05:50.457
Water.

02:05:52.229 --> 02:05:53.898
Aguamenti.

02:05:54.106 --> 02:05:55.566
Water.

02:06:31.745 --> 02:06:33.101
Lumos.

02:07:01.565 --> 02:07:03.441
Lumos Maxima!

02:07:12.929 --> 02:07:14.702
Harry.

02:07:18.768 --> 02:07:19.915
Sectumsempra!

02:07:20.124 --> 02:07:21.270
Harry.

02:07:22.209 --> 02:07:23.773
- Stupefy!
- Harry.

02:08:22.995 --> 02:08:24.246
Harry.

02:08:28.312 --> 02:08:30.606
Partis Temporus!

02:09:13.145 --> 02:09:16.273
Go to your houses. No dawdling.

02:09:57.145 --> 02:10:00.794
We need to get you to the hospital
wing, sir, to Madam Pomfrey.

02:10:03.296 --> 02:10:04.652
No.

02:10:05.694 --> 02:10:08.405
Severus. Severus is who I need.

02:10:08.509 --> 02:10:12.054
Wake him. Tell him what happened.

02:10:12.263 --> 02:10:13.931
Speak to no one else.

02:10:14.557 --> 02:10:16.746
Severus, Harry.

02:10:22.064 --> 02:10:24.462
Hide yourself below, Harry.

02:10:25.921 --> 02:10:28.945
Don't speak or be seen by anybody
without my permission.

02:10:29.049 --> 02:10:32.907
Whatever happens,
it's imperative you stay below.

02:10:33.637 --> 02:10:35.305
Harry, do as I say.

02:10:38.954 --> 02:10:40.205
Trust me.

02:10:41.978 --> 02:10:43.438
Trust me.

02:11:04.082 --> 02:11:05.854
Good evening, Draco.

02:11:06.793 --> 02:11:10.233
What brings you here
on this fine spring evening?

02:11:10.442 --> 02:11:12.214
Who else is here? I heard you talking.

02:11:12.423 --> 02:11:16.489
I often talk aloud to
myself. I find it extraordinarily useful.

02:11:18.575 --> 02:11:21.390
Have you been whispering
to yourself, Draco?

02:11:23.892 --> 02:11:25.352
Draco...

02:11:26.081 --> 02:11:29.001
...you are no assassin.
- How do you know what I am?

02:11:29.209 --> 02:11:30.982
I've done things that would shock you.

02:11:31.190 --> 02:11:35.257
Like cursing Katie Bell and hoping that in
return she'd bear a cursed necklace to me?

02:11:35.465 --> 02:11:38.072
Replacing a bottle of mead
with one laced with poison?

02:11:38.280 --> 02:11:39.844
Forgive me, Draco.

02:11:39.949 --> 02:11:42.451
I cannot help feeling these actions
are so weak...

02:11:42.659 --> 02:11:45.057
...your heart can't really
have been in them.

02:11:45.162 --> 02:11:48.394
He trusts me. I was chosen.

02:11:52.252 --> 02:11:54.024
Then I shall make it easy for you.

02:11:54.128 --> 02:11:55.797
Expelliarmus!

02:11:59.133 --> 02:12:01.531
Very good. Very good.

02:12:03.304 --> 02:12:04.659
You're not alone.

02:12:05.806 --> 02:12:06.849
There are others.

02:12:08.934 --> 02:12:10.289
How?

02:12:11.645 --> 02:12:14.251
The vanishing cabinet
in the Room of Requirement.

02:12:14.981 --> 02:12:17.379
- I've been mending it.
- Let me guess.

02:12:17.588 --> 02:12:20.507
It has a sister. A twin.

02:12:20.716 --> 02:12:22.905
In Borgin and Burkes.
They form a passage.

02:12:23.114 --> 02:12:24.886
Ingenious.

02:12:25.512 --> 02:12:26.763
Draco...

02:12:26.971 --> 02:12:33.019
...years ago, I knew a boy
who made all the wrong choices.

02:12:33.957 --> 02:12:36.877
- Please let me help you.
- I don't want your help!

02:12:37.711 --> 02:12:41.151
Don't you understand? I have to do this.

02:12:42.402 --> 02:12:44.071
I have to kill you.

02:12:44.696 --> 02:12:46.677
Or he's gonna kill me.

02:12:56.270 --> 02:12:59.815
Well, look what we have here.

02:13:01.691 --> 02:13:03.881
Well done, Draco.

02:13:07.530 --> 02:13:09.407
Good evening, Bellatrix.

02:13:10.449 --> 02:13:12.639
I think introductions
are in order, don't you?

02:13:12.743 --> 02:13:17.852
Love to, Albus, but I'm afraid
we're all on a bit of a tight schedule.

02:13:18.582 --> 02:13:19.937
Do it.

02:13:21.189 --> 02:13:25.359
He doesn't have the stomach,
just like his father.

02:13:25.776 --> 02:13:27.236
Let me finish him in my own way.

02:13:27.444 --> 02:13:30.989
No! The Dark Lord was clear,
the boy is to do it.

02:13:31.198 --> 02:13:33.283
This is your moment. Do it.

02:13:34.847 --> 02:13:36.828
Go on, Draco.

02:13:36.932 --> 02:13:39.122
Now!

02:13:40.373 --> 02:13:41.729
No.

02:13:53.615 --> 02:13:55.179
Severus.

02:14:04.145 --> 02:14:05.605
Please.

02:14:06.648 --> 02:14:07.899
Avada Kedavra.

02:14:50.960 --> 02:14:54.192
Yeah!

02:15:12.334 --> 02:15:15.774
Hagrid! Hello?

02:15:15.983 --> 02:15:20.049
Snape! He trusted you!

02:15:24.324 --> 02:15:25.992
Go on.

02:15:26.618 --> 02:15:28.390
Incarcerous.

02:15:28.494 --> 02:15:31.205
Fight back! You coward, fight back!

02:15:32.874 --> 02:15:36.001
No! He belongs to the Dark Lord.

02:15:56.229 --> 02:15:57.584
Sectumsempra!

02:16:06.029 --> 02:16:11.243
You dare use my own spells
against me, Potter?

02:16:12.077 --> 02:16:13.224
Yes.

02:16:13.953 --> 02:16:18.020
I'm the Half-Blood Prince.

02:20:06.149 --> 02:20:07.608
McGONAGALL:
Potter...

02:20:08.338 --> 02:20:10.736
...in light of what has happened...

02:20:12.196 --> 02:20:15.532
...if you should have the need
to talk to someone...

02:20:17.513 --> 02:20:21.475
You should know,
Professor Dumbledore...

02:20:23.352 --> 02:20:25.750
...you meant a great deal to him.

02:20:43.996 --> 02:20:46.186
Do you think he would've done it?

02:20:46.394 --> 02:20:48.271
Draco?

02:20:49.314 --> 02:20:50.669
No.

02:20:51.816 --> 02:20:53.901
No, he was lowering his wand.

02:20:54.944 --> 02:20:56.821
In the end, it was Snape.

02:20:57.551 --> 02:20:59.949
It was always Snape.

02:21:00.157 --> 02:21:02.347
And I did nothing.

02:21:09.020 --> 02:21:10.375
It's fake.

02:21:12.043 --> 02:21:13.294
Open it.

02:21:24.346 --> 02:21:28.308
"To the Dark Lord. I know I will be dead
long before you read this...

02:21:28.517 --> 02:21:32.166
...but I want you to know that it was I
who discovered your secret.

02:21:33.209 --> 02:21:37.066
I have stolen the real Horcrux and intend
to destroy it as soon as I can.

02:21:37.275 --> 02:21:40.299
I face death in the hope that
when you meet your match...

02:21:40.507 --> 02:21:42.697
...you will be mortal once more.

02:21:44.052 --> 02:21:45.616
R.A.B."

02:21:46.972 --> 02:21:48.327
R.A.B.

02:21:48.744 --> 02:21:49.995
Don't know.

02:21:52.080 --> 02:21:54.687
But whoever they are,
they have the real Horcrux.

02:21:55.730 --> 02:21:57.189
Which means it was all a waste.

02:21:58.545 --> 02:22:00.004
All of it.

02:22:06.260 --> 02:22:08.346
Ron's okay with it, you know.

02:22:08.867 --> 02:22:10.327
You and Ginny.

02:22:10.952 --> 02:22:14.706
But if I were you, when he's around,
I'd keep the snogging to a minimum.

02:22:16.060 --> 02:22:18.040
I'm not coming back, Hermione.

02:22:19.190 --> 02:22:21.900
I've got to finish
whatever Dumbledore started.

02:22:22.110 --> 02:22:24.925
And I don't know where that'll lead me...

02:22:25.130 --> 02:22:28.675
...but I'll let you and Ron know
where I am when I can.

02:22:30.030 --> 02:22:32.640
I've always admired your courage, Harry.

02:22:32.850 --> 02:22:35.560
But sometimes, you can be really thick.

02:22:38.580 --> 02:22:40.770
You don't really think
you're going to be able...

02:22:40.980 --> 02:22:43.380
...to find all those Horcruxes
by yourself, do you?

02:22:47.655 --> 02:22:49.215
You need us, Harry.

02:23:05.065 --> 02:23:08.195
I never realized
how beautiful this place was.
