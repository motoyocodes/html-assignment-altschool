        <h2>Biography</h2>
        <h3> Learn A bit about me</h3>  
        <p>Hello&#44; world I&#39;m Omotoyosi Yusuf Zainab&#44; but you can call me Motoyo (trust me&#44; it&#39;s way easier than Zainab for most people). At 22 years old&#44; I&#39;m rocking the dual life of a student&#44;juggling Quantity Surveying at the prestigious University of Lagos and Frontend Engineering at AltSchool Africa&#39;s Tinyuka 24 program. Sounds like a lot? Well&#44; I thrive on challenges and making magic happen in both worlds
            My love affair with technology began just a few months ago&#44; and honestly&#44; it&#39;s been the ride of my life. From the moment I wrote my first line of code&#44; I was hooked. Tech excites me like no other. There&#39;s something thrilling about turning ideas into reality&#44; one function at a time. I&#39;m passionate&#44; driven&#44; and a lifelong learner. In fact&#44; if there&#39;s a new skill or concept to master&#44; count me in!

        While I&#39;m currently diving deep into frontend development&#44; my dreams stretch far and wide. I&#39;m an aspiring full-stack engineer&#44; and who knows&#44; I just might wear the badge of a software engineer soon. I love the idea of creating solutions that make people&#39;s lives better&#44; simpler&#44; and more connected.

        Beyond tech&#44; I love connecting with people&#44; sharing laughs&#44; and finding the silver lining in every situation. My mantra? “If it&#39;s worth doing&#44; do it well”

        In every project&#44; whether it&#39;s coding the perfect UI or calculating complex structures in Quantity Surveying&#44; I bring my A-game. Passion fuels me&#44; curiosity guides me&#44; and hard work keeps me grounded.

        I&#39;m just at the beginning of my journey&#44; but one thing&#39;s for sure: the best is yet to come. So&#44; here&#39;s to big dreams&#44; endless learning&#44; and making the world a smarter&#44; more beautiful place&#44;one line of code at a time!

      <h2>Why I Joined the AltSchoolAfrica Program</h2>
        <p>
          Ever since I was little&#44; I&#39;ve been fascinated by tech like I said before. Fast forward to my 300-level in university&#44; I decided it was time to take this love for tech seriously. Armed with nothing but my laptop and YouTube tutorials&#44; I dove headfirst into the world of tech and I&#39;ve never looked back.

          I&#39;d been seeing AltSchool Africa on twitter for a while&#44; and it always seemed like this amazing place for tech. Then one day&#44; I saw a scholarship opportunity shared by Ruby Lauren&#44; and it felt like the universe was giving me a nudge. I decided to go for it&#44; and after applying and writing the entrance assessment&#44; I did a deep dive into what AltSchool was all about. 

          When I saw that I got a half-scholarship&#44; I was so excited&#44; It felt like destiny&#44; and my journey with AltSchool has been nothing short of amazing so far. The mentorship&#44; the learning&#44; the community it&#39;s all been perfect. I can&#39;t wait to crush my goals&#44; build awesome projects&#44; and make my mark in tech. AltSchool isn&#39;t just a school for me; it&#39;s the place where my dreams are turning into reality.
            I joined the AltSchoolAfrica program to gain a solid foundation in frontend engineering.
          AltSchool offers a unique&#44; practical&#44; and mentorship driven approach to learning. I wanted to learn in a structured environment where I could gain hands-on experience&#44; meet like-minded peers&#44; and be equipped with the skills required to tackle real world problems.
